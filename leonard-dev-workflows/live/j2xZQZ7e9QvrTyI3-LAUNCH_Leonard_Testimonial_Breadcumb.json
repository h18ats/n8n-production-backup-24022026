Our reference title is perennials it is advising Nightingale health on its transfer to the main market of NASDAQ Helsinki and on having its ADRs and B shares quoted on the OTC UX international market.Why did the client come to you for this matter, and what was the outcome for them?I have a strong relationship with the customer and we have worked with them before. And we are advising Nightingale Health on its list transfer from first north to the main market of Nasdaq Helsinki and on having its ADRs, American Depository Receipts, and B-Shares quoted on the OTCQX international market managed by New York headquartered OTC Markets Group Inc.What was the deal size or transaction value for this matter, and were there any notable cost savings or revenue implications for the client?That is not publishable information, unfortunately.Understood. What role did you play, who were the other key team members, and what were their roles? Also, let me know which jurisdictions it involved.The jurisdictions involved are Finland and United States. And our main team who worked on this is our Capital Markets and Public M&A. And our team consists of Juha Koponen, who is our partner, Kenneth Kraszewski, who is our counsel, Aksu Tuominen, who is our counsel, Jere Onnela, who is an associate, and Vilma Kokko, who is Capital Markets Language Specialist.Was there anything noteworthy about the matter? Perhaps something innovative, precedent-setting, or something that impacted regulations or ESG?Yes, the aim of the transfer to the main market in Helsinki and entry to the OTCQX market in New York is to improve the liquidity of the B shares and to achieve a broader and international shareholder base.What is the current status of this matter? If...It is still ongoing and for context, we advised Nightingale Health also on its first note listing in two thousand and twenty-one, and we are more than happy to see the company taking these next steps to support its international growth story.Was there any press coverage or awards related to this matter?Not at this time, and I do not have any additional information at this time. Can you draft a document for us based on this information you have received?Yes, you have all the information correct. I'm sorry, I have to continue to another meeting, but are you able to send me the form via email based on this information?",
