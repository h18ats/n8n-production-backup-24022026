We have a great session on day one called \"Efficiency gains vs. profit: Rethinking AI, pricing & the future legal model\" which I think will be perfect for you. It's a panel discussion that delves into how AI is impacting efficiency and the pressure this puts on traditional billing models. They'll be discussing how to price AI-enhanced work and whether current models are sustainable.\n\nWe also have a session on day one, \"Rethinking growth in the mid-market firm: who’s funding the future?\" which features a panel discussing different funding models, including private equity. They'll be comparing traditional partner funding, employee ownership, and private equity, and exploring the impact on firm culture and long-term sustainability. Does that sound like it covers your interests?",
