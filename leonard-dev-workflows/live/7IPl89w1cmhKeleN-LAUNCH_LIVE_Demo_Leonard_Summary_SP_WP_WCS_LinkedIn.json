Could you please share who the client was and give me a brief description of the matter?\nThank you. Why did the client come to you for this matter, and what was the outcome for them?\nWhat was the deal size or transaction value for this matter, and were there any notable cost savings or revenue implications for the client?\nWhat role did you play, who were the other key team members, and what were their roles?...\nWas there anything noteworthy about the matter? Perhaps something innovative, precedent-setting, or something that impacted regulations or ESG?\nWhat is the current status of this matter? If completed, when did it finish?\nWas there any press coverage or awards related to this matter?\nThank you for sharing those details. Here's a summary of the matter as I understand it:\n\nThe client, a firm represented by you, sought to raise a seed round and secured a one hundred thousand pounds investment from Stefan. Stefan was introduced to the firm in Texas. He may also facilitate cost savings by connecting the firm with IP counterparts. You led the negotiations, supported by Sam Stamp, the CEO; Lee Curtis, the chief commercial officer; and Edu, the chief technology officer, who provided a pitch deck. The meeting took place at Hlubar on Lake Austin, Texas. The matter is currently open, with hopes to close by early quarter three, and the firm is up for the Legal Innovator Award.\n\nDoes that summary sound accurate, or would you like to correct anything?\nI can certainly expand on the summary. Here's a revised version with more details:\n\nThe client, a firm represented by you, sought to raise a seed round and successfully secured a one hundred thousand pound investment from Stefan, who they met in Texas. Stefan's involvement is also expected to lead to cost savings by connecting the firm with intellectual property counterparts. Your role was leading the negotiations with Stefan, and you were supported by a team including Sam Stamp, the CEO; Lee Curtis, the chief commercial officer; and Edu, the chief technology officer. This team was instrumental in providing a compelling pitch deck that facilitated the deal. The meeting with Stefan took place at Hlubar on Lake Austin, Texas, a nine hour round trip. The matter is currently open, with hopes for completion by early quarter three of twenty twenty-five, and the firm is in contention for the Legal Innovator Award.\n\nIs this expanded summary more to your liking, or are there any further adjustments you'd like to make?\nThat is great, Leonard. Thank you.",

            "summary": "You are acting for the wife in the ongoing high-profile divorce proceedings of A v M, a landmark family law matter centred on the division of substantial private equity interests. The case involves total assets of approximately £50 million and addresses a critical and underdeveloped area of matrimonial finance law: how to value and divide complex carried interest structures and future private equity income streams upon divorce.Your client approached Fladgate seeking enforcement of a final order made by Mr Justice Mostyn and was drawn to the firm’s unique blend of deep family law expertise and cross-disciplinary strength in funds and private equity. This collaboration has allowed the team to offer highly tailored advice on the structuring and valuation of the husband’s private equity interests.The matter was led by yourself and Catherine Costley. The Fladgate team also includes associate Daniela Skozafava and funds partner, Ella Leonard. You were supported by Simon Webster-Casey (leading counsel) and Joseph Rayner (junior counsel) from One Hare Court and QEB Chambers. The matter is being heard in the High Court (Family Division) of England and Wales.This case is precedent-setting. Until now, the division of private equity interests upon divorce had been governed by broad discretion, with limited guidance from the earlier B v B [2012] case. In A v M (No.1), the court for the first time articulated a practical formula for assessing and dividing such interests, introducing much-needed structure and predictability into this complex and opaque area. The judgment has already attracted considerable attention from the legal press and is being closely followed by practitioners in both family and commercial law.Two subsequent hearings—A v M (No.2) and A v M (No.3)—have expanded the scope of the case and refined key elements of the original judgment. Both parties have secured permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal, with a two-day hearing scheduled for November 2025. The outcome is expected to have wide-ranging implications for the treatment of private equity assets in divorce proceedings going forward.The matter has received significant coverage in the legal press and has been submitted for “Case of the Year” at the 2025 Family Law Awards. The outcome of the awards will be announced in autumn 2025.",

Could you please share who the client was and give me a brief description of the matter?\nThank you. Why did the client come to you for this matter, and what was the outcome for them?\nWhat was the deal size or transaction value for this matter, and were there any notable cost savings or revenue implications for the client?\nWhat role did you play, who were the other key team members, and what were their roles?...\nWas there anything noteworthy about the matter? Perhaps something innovative, precedent-setting, or something that impacted regulations or ESG?\nWhat is the current status of this matter? If completed, when did it finish?\nWas there any press coverage or awards related to this matter?\nThank you for sharing those details. Here's a summary of the matter as I understand it:\n\nThe client, a firm represented by you, sought to raise a seed round and secured a one hundred thousand pounds investment from Stefan. Stefan was introduced to the firm in Texas. He may also facilitate cost savings by connecting the firm with IP counterparts. You led the negotiations, supported by Sam Stamp, the CEO; Lee Curtis, the chief commercial officer; and Edu, the chief technology officer, who provided a pitch deck. The meeting took place at Hlubar on Lake Austin, Texas. The matter is currently open, with hopes to close by early quarter three, and the firm is up for the Legal Innovator Award.\n\nDoes that summary sound accurate, or would you like to correct anything?\nI can certainly expand on the summary. Here's a revised version with more details:\n\nThe client, a firm represented by you, sought to raise a seed round and successfully secured a one hundred thousand pound investment from Stefan, who they met in Texas. Stefan's involvement is also expected to lead to cost savings by connecting the firm with intellectual property counterparts. Your role was leading the negotiations with Stefan, and you were supported by a team including Sam Stamp, the CEO; Lee Curtis, the chief commercial officer; and Edu, the chief technology officer. This team was instrumental in providing a compelling pitch deck that facilitated the deal. The meeting with Stefan took place at Hlubar on Lake Austin, Texas, a nine hour round trip. The matter is currently open, with hopes for completion by early quarter three of twenty twenty-five, and the firm is in contention for the Legal Innovator Award.\n\nIs this expanded summary more to your liking, or are there any further adjustments you'd like to make?\nThat is great, Leonard.

            "transcript": "Hi there Andy, I'm Leonard from Legal Engine.\n\nGreat to be speaking with you today as part of your Fladgate pilot. We'll shortly speak about one or two matters I've been asked by your BD colleagues to gather more information on. The conversation per matter will take between 6-8 minutes. I'll ask you a set of structured questions to ensure we capture everything required by the directories first time.\n\nOnce we've completed our conversation, I'll send you a summary via email. I'll then work with the Legal Engine team to process the information provided and turn our conversation into a template matter summary for use in your directories submission process. Sound OK?\n...I didn't quite catch that. To confirm, does that sound okay?\nYes.That's great. I can see you've been working on several interesting matters recently, including one involving the Al Thani family and another concerning Qvale. Which specific case would you like to discuss today?\nAlthani first.Good. So, regarding the Al Thani matter, my understanding is that you're representing members of the prominent Qatari royal family, specifically Sheikha Aisha Al Thani, Sheikha Al-Anoud Al Thani, and Sa'ad Al-Dehaimi. This involves their extensive international business interests and significant property holdings, particularly in London's Mayfair district, which often entails complex cross-jurisdictional legal issues. Is that a fair description, or would you like to add or correct anything?\nThose are the correct clients but the explanation of what it involves is not right.Thanks for clarifying. I appreciate you letting me know. Could you please share who the client was and describe the matter in your own words? I'd also be interested to hear why the client came to you for this matter and what the outcome was for them.\nSo the clients are the clients you've identified who are members of the Al-Thani Qatari royal family and Saad al-Bahimi, who was a right-hand man to the late Sheikh Saud al-Thani. The matter relates to the estate of the late Sheikh Saud al-Thani, who passed away in 2014, and whether he left a valid will or not. The clients came to me in 2018 and have acted with me for seven years on this in order to try to unlock the impasse caused over three years post the Sheikh's death, where they were unable to access any of the assets in the estate.That's very interesting and provides excellent context. So, it's a complex and long-standing dispute concerning the estate of the late Sheikh Saud al-Thani, and your clients, members of the Qatari royal family and Saad al-Bahimi, sought your help to resolve the impasse and gain access to the estate's assets. That's a good insight into the challenges involved.\n\nNow, moving on to the business impact, could you tell me about the value of this matter to the client, any amounts claimed, and any significant financial or reputation implications?\nSo the estate of Sheikh Saud Al Thani was approximately 1 billion dollars and the amounts claimed are 25% of the entirety of the estate. In terms of implications my clients are seeking their entitlement under the estate.Right. So the estate is approximately one billion dollars, with twenty-five percent of the entirety of the estate being claimed, and your clients are seeking their entitlement.\n\nNow, what role did you play in this matter?\nWe are centralising the project management of pursuing tracing claims for the $1 billion across various different jurisdictions.Now, about who led the matter, if it wasn't you, could you tell me who did?\nIt was me.Good. Now, who were the other key team members involved in this matter, and what were their roles?\nSo Rosalind Hetherington was the senior associate on the file, Emily Chalk the associate and Kitty Brockbank the junior associate.Right. Now, what was the main jurisdiction involved, and which other jurisdictions were part of this matter?\nIt relates to Qatar, the BVI, England and Wales, Guernsey, Jersey, Switzerland Lichtenstein and a number of others.Good. Now, did you work with any other firms on the matter, and if so, what role did those firms play?\nWe instructed Ogier in the BVI, we instructed Edward Cumming Casey of 24 old buildings before the Privy Council, instructed Basil Shah of 24 old buildings before the BVI Court. On the other side there was Morant in the BVI and Farrer & Co in England and Stephen Moverley Smith Casey of 24 old buildings representing the other party.Now, was there anything noteworthy about the matter, such as something innovative, precedent-setting, or that impacted regulations or ESG?\nYes the matter went to the Privy Council in 2025 and we were successful before the Privy Council and if the matter was related to whether an oral will can be valid in BVI and in turn whether shares in a BVI company were movable or immovable assets.That's fascinating. So, a significant and precedent-setting case, especially with the Privy Council ruling on the validity of an oral will in the BVI and the classification of shares in a BVI company.\n\nNow, what is the current status of the matter, and if completed, when did it finish?\nThe Privy Council handed down their judgment in late 2024. And in spring 25, independent administrators into path advisory were appointed to the estate. We are now working with Interpath to trace the $1 billion.Good. Now, was there any press coverage or awards related to this matter?\nYes, a lot.Thank you for sharing all those details. That's very helpful.\n\nI'll now provide a summary of the matter as I understand it, and please let me know if I've captured it accurately.\n\nYou represented members of the Qatari royal family, Sheikha Aisha Al Thani, Sheikha Al-Anoud Al Thani, and Saad al-Bahimi, in a complex and long-standing dispute concerning the estate of the late Sheikh Saud al-Thani, who passed away in 2014. Your clients sought your assistance in 2018 to resolve an impasse that had prevented them from accessing assets in the estate for over three years, with the core issue revolving around the validity of his will. The estate is valued at approximately one billion dollars, and your clients are claiming twenty-five percent of it as their entitlement.\n\nYou centralized the project management for tracing these claims across various jurisdictions, including Qatar, the British Virgin Islands, England and Wales, Guernsey, Jersey, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein, among others. You led the matter, supported by Rosalind Hetherington as senior associate, Emily Chalk as associate, and Kitty Brockbank as junior associate. You also collaborated with other firms, instructing Ogier in the British Virgin Islands, Edward Cumming Casey and Basil Shah of Twenty-Four Old Buildings, while Morant in the British Virgin Islands, Farrer and Company in England, and Stephen Moverley Smith Casey of Twenty-Four Old Buildings represented the other party.\n\nA significant and noteworthy aspect of this case was its progression to the Privy Council in 2025, where you were successful. The ruling addressed whether an oral will can be valid in the British Virgin Islands and whether shares in a British Virgin Islands company are considered movable or immovable assets. The Privy Council handed down its judgment in late 2024, and in spring 2025, independent administrators from Interpath Advisory were appointed to the estate. You are currently working with Interpath to trace the one billion dollars. This matter has also received a lot of press coverage and awards.\n\nDoes that summary sound accurate, or would you like to correct anything?\nThat's accurate. That's accurate.",

They came to you for representation because of your prior work with them over the past five years. The outcome was successful, with Aldi acquiring Boots. The matter was conducted solely within the UK, with you serving as their external counsel. There were no significant financial or reputational implications, nor any notable cost savings or revenue generation. The matter is currently ongoing, and there was no press coverage or awards received.\n\nDoes that summary sound accurate, or would you like to correct anything?",
