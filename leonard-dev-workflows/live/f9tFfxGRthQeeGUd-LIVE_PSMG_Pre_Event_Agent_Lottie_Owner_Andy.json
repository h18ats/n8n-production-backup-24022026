We have a couple of sessions that touch on this.\n\nRachel Hussey from Arthur Cox is giving the Chair's Opening Speech at 09:00, focusing on \"Leadership in Transformation.\" Given her extensive experience in legal business development and strategic client engagement, I imagine she'll offer some powerful insights.\n\nWe also have a panel session at 16:45 called \"In Conversation With...\", moderated by Owen Williams. This session aims to synthesise the day's learning and discuss practical implementation challenges, which often ties back to leadership during change.\n\nDoes either of those sound like they might align with what you're looking for?
