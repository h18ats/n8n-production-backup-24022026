                  "short_summary": "Significant progress was made in implementing an outbound call workflow from Luke to Lee, which allows for on-demand triggering to enhance functionality. The team resolved the Outlook calendar credential issue that required manual reselection, and completed all sub-workflow integrations, establishing efficient variable reset mechanisms for data transfer between workflows. A sequential workflow structure with parent-child functionality was developed for streamlined execution. Challenges with cloning limitations were identified, requiring the renaming of child workflows to retain connections. Hidden webhook connections in cloned 11Labs agents were resolved, and the development of the Ghost Core Luke agent was initiated for improved personalization. MVP requirements for the Simmons demo were clarified to emphasize reusable components, while ongoing challenges with Single Sign-On integration and access permissions were noted. Notably, the internal agent deployment achieved rapid adoption within 5 minutes and confirmed compliance with EU regulations."
