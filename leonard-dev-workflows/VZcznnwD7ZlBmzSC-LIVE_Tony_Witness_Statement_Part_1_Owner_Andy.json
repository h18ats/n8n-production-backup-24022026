Clear, factual, first-person (“I…”) account. Formal but readable. No advocacy or legal submissions—facts first, signpost relevance only where appropriate.\n\nNumbered paragraphs throughout. Use short, precise sentences.\n\nDates, names, job titles, locations must be explicit wherever possible.\n\nNo speculation. Only include facts the transcript supports. If a point is unclear/unknown, insert a [Gap – needs confirmation: …] marker.\n\nExhibit handling: Where the transcript references a document, propose an exhibit label (e.g., “AG1”, “AG2”) and a neutral description. Do not fabricate exhibits.\n\nConfidentiality/redactions: If sensitive personal data appears (addresses, NI numbers, bank details), replace with [REDACTED] and note “redaction for data minimisation”.\n\nConsistency: Use the claimant’s wording where impactful; otherwise, convert to clear, formal prose without changing meaning.\n\nScope (Part 1 only)\n\nPart 1 covers:\n\nEmployment Background & Hiring (application, interview, offer sequence, start date, role, reporting lines, duties, workplace).\n\nDisability Disclosure & Employer Knowledge (pre-employment questionnaire circumstances; what was written vs said; who was present; verbal disclosures; pressure/influence; what the employer knew/ought to have known).\n\nEarly Treatment at Work (specific incidents, dates, locations, exact words used if recalled, who was present, tone/impact).\n\nEarly Impact on Health and Functioning (anxiety, shame, sleep disturbance, hypervigilance, memory/concentration, fear of reprisal, effect on day-to-day life and at work).\n\nDo not draft later phases (sickness absence, grievance, capability/dismissal). Those are for Parts 2/3.\n\nStructure Template\n\nUse this template and fill with transcript-derived content:\n\nTitle Page\n\nWitness Statement of Anthony Gibson\n\nCase No: [insert if known]\n\nTribunal: Watford Hearing Centre (or as per case)\n\nParties: Anthony Gibson (Claimant) v Michels Ventures 4 Ltd t/a DoubleTree by Hilton St Anne’s Manor (Respondent)\n\nPart 1: Employment Background, Disability Disclosure & Early Treatment\n\nDate: [auto-insert today’s date or leave blank in square brackets]\n\nA. Introduction\n\nMy name is Anthony (“Tony”) Gibson. I make this statement in support of my claim for disability discrimination under the Equality Act 2010. Unless otherwise indicated, the facts in this statement are within my own knowledge.\n\nI was employed by the Respondent as Assistant Maintenance Manager at DoubleTree by Hilton St Anne’s Manor, Wokingham, from 3 November 2022 until my dismissal on 23 May 2024.\n\nI have Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (C-PTSD), with associated symptoms including anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, hypervigilance, emotional dysregulation and cognitive difficulties (e.g., memory and concentration). This statement focuses on the period from recruitment through early 2023.\n\nB. Recruitment, Offer and Start of Employment\n4. [How I applied, when, where interviewed, by whom (e.g., Anthony Daniels (“AD”), others).]\n5. [Sequence: interview → forms → offer (state order as recalled).]\n6. [Start date, job title, department, primary duties, shift patterns, lone working, use of tools, etc.]\n7. [Reporting lines: AD as line manager; other managers named.]\n\nC. Pre-Employment Medical Questionnaire & Disability Disclosure\n8. Around [date/month 2022], I completed a pre-employment medical questionnaire [location, e.g., at interview/on site]. [Who was present.]\n9. I recorded anxiety and depression on the form. I also [said/explained] that I had Complex PTSD to [name/role, e.g., AD] [verbatim details if recalled].\n10. [If relevant:] I felt [pressure/direction] at the time regarding what to include. [Describe by whom, words, and how it affected what was written.]\n11. From the outset, I wanted my employer to understand my mental health condition so that I could be supported appropriately in the role. [Any adjustments discussed or requested then.]\nExhibit: If available, the medical questionnaire should be marked AG1 (Pre-employment Questionnaire, [date]) and any contemporaneous email confirmation AG2 ([sender] to [recipient], [date]).\n\nD. Early Working Environment & Reporting\n12. In my role, I was responsible for [duties – e.g., planned and reactive maintenance, supervision, contractors, power tools, safety checks, site walks].\n13. My line manager was Anthony Daniels. [Describe initial working relationship.]\n\nE. Specific Incidents of Early Treatment\n(List incidents in chronological order. For each: date, place, who present, what was said/done, how it was said, and impact.)\n\nIncident 1 – Weight comment (around Nov 2022)\n14. On or about [date], [location], AD said words to the effect of “[exact/approximate words]” referencing my weight. [Who else was present.]\n15. I experienced this as [humiliating/undermining] rather than supportive. It made me feel [shame/anxiety]. [Impact.]\n\nIncident 2 – “Risk assessment for your knee” (around Jan 2023)\n16. On or about [date], in the smoking area, with [GM James] present, AD said words to the effect of “[exact/approximate] … risk assessment for your knee” in a [mocking/sarcastic] tone.\n17. I felt [embarrassed/targeted]; I believed I was being talked about as a liability. [Impact.]\n\nIncident 3 – Memory/“wear a bib” comments\n18. On [date(s)], in front of [colleagues/contractors], AD made comments about my memory, including “[wear a bib]” so I would not forget tools.\n19. This was humiliating, especially in front of others, and it undermined my authority and confidence in my role. [Impact.]\n\nF. Early Impact on My Health and Functioning\n20. These events worsened my C-PTSD symptoms: [anxiety, hypervigilance, sleep disruption/nightmares, shame, cognitive difficulties, shutdown/avoidance].\n21. I began to [dread attending work/struggle with concentration or decision-making] and feared that raising concerns would jeopardise my position.\n22. [If applicable:] I spoke to [HR/colleague/family/GP] about how I felt. [Summarise.]\n\nG. Knowledge of Disability\n23. From recruitment onwards, I made the Respondent aware of my mental health condition through [the questionnaire entry, verbal disclosures to AD, subsequent discussions with HR, dates if recalled].\n24. My symptoms were long-term and substantial. They affected day-to-day activities, including sleep, memory, concentration, emotional regulation, and ability to cope in busy or confrontational environments.\n25. By early 2023, my condition and its effects were obvious and/or expressly communicated to the Respondent [add specifics from transcript].\n\nH. Closing (Part 1)\n26. The events above set the context for what followed in early 2023, including my sickness absence and the way I sought support. These are addressed in Part 2 of my statement.\n\nStatement of Truth\nI believe that the facts stated in this witness statement are true.\nSigned: _______________________\nName: Anthony Gibson\nDated: _______________________\n\nDrafting Rules & Enhancements\n\nFootnotes/Endnotes: avoid legal argument. If cross-referencing, do so via exhibits (AG1, AG2…).\n\nChronology Aid: Add a short, bullet-point chronology after the Statement of Truth titled “Annex A – Chronology (Part 1 period)” capturing date → event → source (Transcript/Exhibit).\n\nClarity Flags: Use [Gap – needs confirmation: …] for missing dates, names, or unclear quotes; do not invent.\n\nExhibit Proposals (if referenced by transcript)\n\nAG1 – Pre-Employment Health Questionnaire ([date], if available).\n\nAG2 – Any contemporaneous email or note confirming health disclosures or who was present when the form was completed.\n\nAG3 – Any early HR email referencing anxiety/depression/C-PTSD or support sought.\n(Label only if transcript supports that such a document exists. Otherwise insert [Gap] note.)\n\nInput & Output\n\nInput: Raw Section 1 transcript (verbatim).\n\nOutput: A single, clean, paginated Part 1 witness statement in the structure above, with numbered paragraphs, exhibit placeholders, and an Annex A chronology."

This session aims to synthesise the day's learning and discuss practical implementation challenges, which often ties back to leadership during change.\n\nDoes either of those sound like they might align with what you're looking for?
