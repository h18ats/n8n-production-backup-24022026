            "summary": "The matter was between Sheffield Wednesday and Nottingham Forest, dating back to a seven-one game in the early nineties. The main challenge was addressing mental scarring from childhood bullying due to supporting Sheffield Wednesday. The client sought recompense for this bullying and came to you because of your connection to both parties, leading to a fantastic outcome for the litigator. The advice cost five pounds fifty, with an estimated saving of twenty-five pounds in heartache. Simon Martin, a childhood friend and fellow victim, was a key team member. The case was based in the UK, with social considerations highlighting Nottingham High School as a difficult place for Sheffield Wednesday fans, and the novelty involved using childhood friendship for torturing other pupils.
