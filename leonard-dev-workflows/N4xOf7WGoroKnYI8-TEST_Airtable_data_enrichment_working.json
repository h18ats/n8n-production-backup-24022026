You’ve already been ranked in [Chambers / Legal 500 / IFLR]—nice work. But wouldn't it be better to spend less time telling the world how good you are, and more time being it?\nMeet Leonard, our AI directories assistant, who can write all your matter summaries for you:.\n🧠 Thousands of submissions worth of knowledge  \n📞 A 6-minute (one uinit) structured conversation  \n📄 A polished, submission-ready matter summary  \n\n\n\nRelevant context about Legal Engine and Leonard in order to helkp you sell:\n- The Big Picture:\nLegal Engine is building a team of AI-powered voice Assistants to unlock significant\ngrowth opportunities for law firms.\nWe’re creating a new category of agentic voice AI, tools designed to free lawyers and\nbusiness services teams from the repetitive, unstructured work that underpins growth\nbut sits outside billable legal delivery.\nBy doing this we will save millions in wasted resource capital allocation and create a\ndynamic knowledge layer that can unlock millions in latent revenue opportunities\nthrough real-time referrals.\n- The Problem\nLaw Firms are highly inefficient at converting opportunities into revenue.\nThis is because law firm growth is still powered by manual, repetitive, people-\ndependent processes, especially in Marketing & Business Development (MBD).\n• The same information is requested and rewritten repeatedly\n• CRMs are never up to date\n• BD teams chase inputs, lawyers waste time giving them\n• Valuable insights from both client and internal meetings and completed matters are\nlost\n• Marketing content is shallow or delayed\n• Cross-sell and referral opportunities are not identified or slip through the cracks\nThis inefficiency translates into slower growth, higher costs, and millions in unrealised\nrevenue each year.\n- Introducing Legal Engine\nLegal Engine is building a team of voice-based AI Assistants to take on the routine, but\nessential, business development tasks that drain time, delay growth, and rely too\nheavily on manual effort.\nOur Assistants will:\n• Capture and structure commercial and marketing insights from a single, expert-led\nconversation\n• Generate reusable outputs; from directory submissions to CRM updates and BD\nassets\n• Integrate seamlessly into firms’ existing systems to distribute information and make\nit available to everyone\nThey require no training, no interface learning, simply a structured conversation via a\nmedium lawyers are used to and comfortable with.\nCapture once, use endlessly.\n- Meet our first Assistant, Leonard\nLeonard automates a critical, high-friction process for law firms –\ngathering matter summaries for Directories, Pitches & Credentials.\nLeonard does this by:\n• Conducts structured interviews with lawyers\n• Produces formatted submissions aligned to Legal 500 and\nChambers guidelines\n• Creates complementary assets for pitches, bios, and web profiles\n• Integrates updates directly into CRM and matter management\nplatforms\nProof-of-concept pilots with top-50 UK firms validating product-\nmarket fit and live conversations for paid deployment in Q3 2025.\n- Leonard: how it works\nExpert-led conversations to create commercial assets.\nLeonard has been trained on industry best practice and imbued with\ndecades of our professional service experience, enabling him to\nspeak to a lawyer via phone (inbound our outbound) and ask\nstructured, domain-specific questions to elicit the right answers\nWithin seconds, Leonard produces:\n1. A submission-quality matter summary\n2. Pitch, credential, website and social and content\n3. CRM-ready data updates\n4. Suggestions of client follow-ups and introductions\nAll securely processed with minimal user effort.\n- Product Vision\nLeonard is just the beginning, we are building a series of\ncomplementary Assistants.\nWe are initially targeting the routine processes that we know are\nefficiency-drains – drafting business development plans, managing\nsales funnels, launching events, creating marketing content – to\nremove the 'information leakage' that happens daily at law firms,\ncausing re-work, leaving billable revenue on the table and slowing\ndown growth.\nAll agents will capture knowledge that is not currently written\ndown feeding a unified, firm-wide knowledge base that will\nultimately be able to make connections and referrals within the\nfirm that unlock revenue opportunities.\n- Our Assistants: how they work\nAll our Assistants will be modular,\nsecure and customisable.\nOur moat is our years of experience,\nencoded into the Assistants we are\nbuilding, coupled with the plumbing of\nknitting the best available tools for each\nelement of the task.\nWe are focusing on enterprise-grade\nsecurity from Day One, with EEA data\nresidency or on-premise deployment as\nstandard.\n- Business Model – Assistant Value Pricing\nOur Assistants are priced like hires, with price scaling in line with value delivered.\nWe’re not just selling software; we’re selling Expert Assistants who can get specific work\ndone that creates direct and measurable value for a firm.\nOur Assistants don't just rely on AI, they are trained and honed by a team of industry\nexperts, with a combined 75 years of experience and can be individually onboarded to\nfirms, just like a human assistant, imbued with specific knowledge to improve their output.\nFirms will “hire” our Assistants to do “work\", paying for the value created, just as if they\nwere hiring human resource to do the same thing, but at a fraction of the cost and with\nmuch greater efficiency.\nStarter Assistants: ~£1,000/month or up to £10k / project\nAdvanced Assistants: £2,000–£3,000/month or up to £25k / project\n\nInput Variable:\n- Homepage content: {{ $('Limit Markdown6').item.json.limitedMarkdown }}\n- Domain name: {{ $('Set Users Company Domain5').item.json.domain }}\n- Demolink: {{ $('Set Legal Engine Demolinik3').item.json.demolink }}\n- Recipient: {{ $('Read List of Leads2').item.json['First Name'] }}\n\nYou MUST write with UK English spelling, punctuationand grammer and NOT US English\n\nThe output must be valid JSON with only \"title\" and \"body\" fields, where body contains the complete HTML template above with ultra-personalized content."
