If you share and tag @legal engine, I’ll happily send you some free Leonard credits so we can chat again. \n\n---\n\n{{ $('AI Agent all Assets').item.json.output }}\n\n---\n\nThis is also only a snapshot of what I can do. The team are building more agents like me to support marketing and BD teams with events, pitches, client teams and much more.  Visit https://legalengine.co.uk for more information on our product suite.  \n\nIf you need further support or have additional questions please contact my team at info@legalengine.co.uk.\n\nCheers,\n\nLeonard\n\nLegal Engine AI Agent\n\n",

Once we've completed our conversation I'll send you a summary to leonard@legalengine.co.uk. Tell me about a matter you worked on to get a sense for what I'm capable of?||Yeah, so a matter between Shepard Winslow and Nottingham Forest.||Okay, I understand. To get started, could you tell me what the matter involved, including the main challenge or objective?||Yes, it was going back to the early 90s when Nottingham Forest beat Sheffield Wednesday 7-1 and I was starting to have mental scarring as a result.||Thank you for sharing that. Why did the client come to you for this matter, and what specific problem were they trying to solve?||They were trying to solve for mental torture and scarring as a result of childhood bullying for supporting a rubbish team.||I see. What was the outcome for the client, and what specific positive impact did your team provide to the client to achieve this outcome? Please also mention how this matter aligned with the client's strategic objectives.||Yes, so the client's strategic objectives were to seek recompense for childhood bullying. They came to me because I'm known to both parties and produced a fantastic outcome for the litigator.||And what was the deal size or transaction value for this matter? Were there any notable cost savings or revenue implications for the client?||It was $5,050 for the advice and I think I saved £25 in heartache.||Okay, thank you. And who were the key team members who worked with you on this matter, and what were their roles?||The main one was Simon Martin and he was there as a childhood friend and fellow victim of said bullying.||Understood. How many jurisdictions were involved in this matter, and which were the primary ones?||This was just the UK case.||Were there any innovative legal approaches or novel issues you addressed in this matter, including any precedent-setting aspects? Are there any regulatory impact or sustainability or social considerations worth highlighting?||Yeah, just social considerations were Nottingham High School was a horrible place to attend as a Sheffield Wednesday fan. And so, you know, the novelty was really around using childhood friendship as a way of torturing other pupils.||And what is the current status of this matter? If completed, when did it finish?||No, it's still open. I still get regularly shown up for my allegiance to the Owls.||Understood. Was there any press coverage or awards related to this matter that we should mention?||Not really. The Nottingham Evening Post covered it at the time, based on their own gleefulness at the victory.||Thank you for sharing those details.
