Know you need to do it to progress but are struggling for ideas?\nWe get it. That’s why we created Three Things, a weekly BD punch in the arm with, you guessed it, three quick, practical things you can do (not just read and say “I should definitely do that”) every week to increase your client interactions and sales success. \nOur commitment to you:\n•\tEach installment will take 3mins or less to read.\n•\tEach activity will take 3 units of time or less to execute.\nSignup here to get your weekly BD & sales injection delivered to your inbox every Monday morning and start your week with a bang!\nEnjoy!\nReflect: what went well last year from a BD/sales perspective? What activities won you business? What did you put loads of effort into but with little return. Write yourself a list (see below) of things you are going to Stop, Start, and Continue on the BD and Sales front in 2024. \nStop\tStart\tContinue\nActivities and vanity projects that add little value and revenue to your practice.\tIdentify activities you have seen colleagues and competitors engage in that were successful.\tIf it aint broke…. Look for opportunities to reuse what went well last year.\n\nLooking back: which clients did you work with in 2023? Which clients lapsed in 2023 that you have enjoyed working with previously? Make a quick list of these clients and send them a New Year email like the below. This will get you back on their 2024 radar.\n-------------------------\nHi [first name]\nHappy New Year. I hope you had a restful festive period and managed to spend some time with the family.\nWould be great to catch up in the coming weeks and understand your priorities for 2024. I can also share with you our team’s views on the current state of the market and what to watch out for as the year unfolds.\nI’ve copied [PA name] who can liaise with [client PA name if known / otherwise “your PA”] to find a suitable slot.\nI look forward to hearing from you.\nKind regards\n [signature] \n-----------------------------------------------------\nTidying up: do you still have a bunch of “pending” opportunities from 2023? Pitches you put in that haven’t yet received a response? Quotes you still need an answer on? Intro meetings you were trying to arrange that are stuck with PAs/crazy calendars? The new year provides an ideal time to follow up on these outstanding items and, who knows, could be an awesome start to the year!\n\nEnjoyed reading this? Signup here to get Three Things delivered straight to your inbox every Monday morning.\n \n22/01/24 – The coffee catch up\nIt’s January, the start of a new year and I’m confident BD teams up and down the country are rightly encouraging their revenue generators to get out there/shake the tree/take someone for coffee etc.\nProblem is, once you’re there, in a one on one meeting environment, what do you do? What do you say? How do you get value out of the conversation?\nHere’s three ways to ensure you’re getting the most out of that Cappuccino.\n•\tPreparation: if someone has taken time out of their busy day to meet with you then you should, as a minimum, prep accordingly. Things to consider include:\n•\tPurpose: what are you there for? Informal catch up? Shooting the breeze? Intelligence gathering? Feedback? All of these are great reasons to catch up but it’s useful to understand upfront the purpose of the catch up.\n•\tResearch: for new/less well known clients its always useful pre catch up to LinkedIn stalk them (do you have any shared connections or interests?) and use Google News to highlight major stories about their business.\n•\tGuests: consider if it’s worth taking a colleague. Ideally, this would be someone with a skillset that would be useful to your contact.\n•\tVenue: sounds daft but make sure you pick a meet up point where it’s easy to hear the other person clearly!\n•\tIn the meeting: please, please, please do not approach the catch up thinking you need to instantly win work! View this meeting as an opportunity to get to know the person sitting opposite you. Other things to think about:\n•\tLife then work: do not dive straight in with work chat! Talk about the journey in, the weather (English people LOVE the weather chat!), Love Island, the football last night, politics and/or your latest podcast. This will help to build a relationship.\n•\tFind common ground: do you both have kids? Pets? Like running, travel, sports? Do you live near to each other? Again, bringing a human touch to the conversation will establish rapport much quicker. \n•\tListen more than talk: easy to say, harder to do! Be curious and ask open questions. How’s the job? What are you hoping to achieve this year? What does the next three months look like for you? What’s the biggest issue currently sat on your desk?\n•\tThe follow up: the catch up’s gone well. Your coffee mate has mentioned a couple of things of interest. All done right? WRONG! Missing the follow up opportunity is like being handed the keys to the sweet shop and not going inside! \n•\tSay thanks: if nothing else a quick email/WhatsApp thanking someone for their time goes a long way.\n•\tDo what you said you were going to do: if you mentioned introducing a colleague, supplier, vendor make sure you facilitate the intro. If you were going to send a link, article, document then prioritise this before you forget.\n•\tArrange the next catch up: us the follow up comms to get a date in the diary for another catch up. \n \n29/01/24 – generating interest\nStaying front of mind with existing customers and new prospects is an important tool in any successful sales arsenal.  Building an online presence to showcase your experience and expertise allows you to subtly infiltrate your buyer’s ecosystem so that, when your approach becomes more tailored, they will already recognise you as a name within your chosen field. So, how do you generate interest in you and the services you can provide? This week, we look at three tried and tested methods for success. \n•\tTake a view: many professional services firms issue regular market updates on landmark deals, regulatory change and important court decisions. Whilst these summarised versions may hold some value to the reader if delivered quickly (see KISS below), the increased use of Gen AI to deliver these summaries to the same, or better, level of quality will make differentiation even more difficult going forwards. Taking a view or position on a topic provides the reader with your perspective and allows them to agree or challenge the view you have taken. In an online environment such as LinkedIn, this can prompt others to chip in with their perspective, instantly creating opportunities for you to engage with new prospects. \n•\tKeep It Short & Speedy (KISS): attention spans online are incredibly short. If you haven’t hooked the reader in the first 15 secs then you’ve probably lost them. Short punchy articles which clearly articulate the topic in question, the impact on your customers and your view of next steps are the way to go. Leave the weightier articles to legal journals and/or specialist industry publications. A short but well written piece delivered quickly to key customers puts you ahead of the competition. FACT. In our experience, perfection and review by committee have got in the way of many a critical update resulting in the competition being in front of your customers quicker than you. In some circumstances, speed to market might just be your only differentiator. 90% and good is much better than 100% and late. \n•\tRepeat and reuse: generating content takes time. To maximise the exposure of anything you produce, consider the various channels available for distribution of that content and how the content might differ slightly between audiences. For example, a decision has just been handed down which will impact your customer base. What do you do?\n•\tConduct a quick impact analysis with the team: get some heads together and work out the top 3-5 implications of the decision on your client base. Then ask a team member to draft up a short (400 words / 2 mins reading time MAX) impact statement. Review quickly and publish on your website/LinkedIn. Ideally, this needs to be done within ½ business day of the event you are talking about being released (see KISS point above).\n•\tPhone/email TOP 10 clients: prioritise your most important customers to receive special treatment. It’s a great opportunity to pick up the phone and say “Have you seen the latest decision in XXX vs. YYY? I think it will have implications for your business and am happy to talk them through. Have you got 5 mins for me to run you through it?” If you don’t feel comfortable doing this then, (i) learn to get comfortable doing it!, and (ii) at the very least, send your top customers a link to your article (or a personal message on LinkedIn) and take the time to add a sentence or two on how you think the decision could impact them.\n•\tDecide if there is a media angle: talk to your PR/Comms team. Journos are always keen to talk to professionals who will have a view on the decision. Be careful to tread the line between having a view (great) and taking a line which your firm and customers might think is sub optimal. \n\n \n05/02/24 – Oi! Are you listening?\nIt’s 1100. You’re on your fourth call of the day, the Amazon delivery has just arrived. You turn your camera off to answer the door and make yourself another coffee to get you through the rest of the morning. Then, there’s silence on the other end of the screen. “Lee are you still there?”. Sh^t! You’ve missed the question. “Yes, sorry, can you repeat that pls?”\nSound familiar? In the modern world with its almost limitless competing distractions, it can be hard to give your full attention to one of the most powerful tools in sales – listening. This week we’ve dedicated Three Things to a skill most learn within months of being born but few ever master. Enjoy.\nWe have two ears and one mouth so that we can listen twice as much as we speak. Epictetus\nRemove distractions\nWhether you are in an online, virtual on in person situation it is critical to give the person you are listening to your full, unwavering attention. At the very least this will demonstrate that you are interested in what they have to say. \nIf online, make sure the camera is on (I hope you wouldn’t walk into a meeting with a paper bag on your head) and that you sit forward in your chair. Turn your email and WhatsApp notifications off, put the dog in the garden and tell the Amazon driver to leave the parcel on the porch. \nFor an in-person meeting, the drill is the same. Listening is a whole-body exercise – use a leaning forward position to look engaged and curious. Maintain regular eye contact with your subject. Unless you’re taking notes on it, make sure your phone is on silent and out of reach to avoid email checking. In a meeting environment with multiple parties ensure you give each party your full attention. \nSilence is golden\nThe most important thing in communication is hearing what isn't said. \nPeter Drucker\nWe live in a time where every second is precious and you’re likely to be running from meeting to meeting all day. Provide your speaker with the space to express their full views without being interrupted. Let them speak at their own cadence so that they fully articulate their thought process. Whilst extended periods of silence can feel uncomfortable (especially for this author), these can be incredibly valuable. Spend the time observing your speaker and looking for non-verbal cues as to how they are feeling about the subject matter. \nDO NOT:\n•\tTry and complete someone’s sentence or thought for them!\n•\tCut them off mid-sentence with a phrase like “Yes, I completely agree” in a effort to move onto the next point.\nShow you’ve listened \nA very simple technique to demonstrate your understanding of what’s been said is to summarise what you’ve heard back to the person talking. This is best done at regular intervals during natural pauses in the conversation. If you wait to the end of the conversation, it can seems unnatural and you are more likely to forget something. Not only does a summary of what you’ve heard demonstrate listening, it can also clarify your interpretation of what has been said aligns with your speaker.\n \n12/02/24 – Let’s celebrate!\n\nToday is my daughter’s 5th birthday. Whilst recovering from her party (think 20+ kids, a Disney princess and Frozen on repeat) over the weekend, I started to think about the relationship development and sales opportunities that present themselves as a result of celebratory events in business life. \nAs a species, we are not great at standing back and recognising our (or importantly, other people’s) achievements. The pace of life means that we allow significant work events and milestones to pass us by quickly so we can move onto the next “thing”.\nThis week’s Three Things are all about maximising celebrations. Enjoy (and Happy Birthday Stevie!)\nJob moves/promotions: \nTracking your contacts as they move through their employment lifecycle can reap rich rewards. In many industries (e.g. financial services) there is significant churn, a situation which continues to increase as employee loyalty decreases. \nLinkedIn is a powerful ally in helping to alert you when a contact changes roles and/or companies. Filters can be applied to identify which of your contacts have recently moved.  \nIn addition to the obligatory “all the best”, “great move” or “they’re so lucky to have you”, make a point of emailing your separately to congratulate them. Suggest a catch up once they’ve been in role for a month to see how they’re getting on and how you can support going forward. For example, you may be able to introduce them to colleagues you already know at their organisation, or be part of industry groups you are already part of.\nFor contacts who have been promoted, there might be the opportunity to connect them with peers at different firms, and/or suggest a mentor/coach.\nDeal closing/project completions:  \nIt’s likely we’ve all been on big projects that have involved intense periods and late nights to get them over the line. There may have been a congratulatory email, a couple of drinks in the pub or even a closing dinner but, very soon, it’s onto the next project. This is a huge, missed opportunity for a couple of main reasons:\n•\tFeedback: before your key stakeholders forget about the work you put in and the product/service you delivered, make sure you sit down with them to get feedback on your team’s performance. Whether it’s verbal feedback over a coffee, a more formal lessons learned session with the team (VERY USEFUL) or a written/video testimonial for the website, all feedback is useful in helping you to improve the service you deliver.\n•\tBilling: some large projects are structured where payment is required on completion. The best time to get these bills paid are between 1-3 days of the project completing. Why? Because the pain the project team all felt, the effort your team put in and the fact you successfully contributed to the project completion will still all be fresh in the mind for the payee!\nInternal celebrations:\nIn any month within your organisation there will be a variety of events to celebrate. Think birthdays, new borns, weddings, new puppy etc. In a hybrid world, the ability to bring people together and celebrate these events has become more difficult. If you’re a manager, use these situations as a reason to bring the team together for a social and some team building. For those without team management responsibilities make the extra effort to get into the office on these days and build your relationships with colleagues. You never know when you might need them!  \n \n19/02/24 – The Networking Edition \nWe’ve all been there. You accept an invitation to an industry networking event, pop it in the diary and then promptly forget about it. The day arrives and you remind your colleague about the event (they said they’d go with you – it’s MUCH easier when you go with someone you know) only to find out they have a sick child and now can’t make it.\nSh^t! You realise you’re on your own.  That familiar panic starts to bubble up inside. What should I do? What am I going to say? I don’t know anyone!\nFear not. Help is at hand. Take three minutes out of your day to read this week’s Three Things dedicated to a topic that causes untold amounts of anxiety across all levels within professional services – the networking event. Enjoy.\nDo your prep:\nTo be successful at anything in life takes practice and preparation. The same is true for networking events. At first, the tips contained here will feel uncomfortable and awkward. Persevere. The more you practice, the better you will get. Preparation for each event is critical but follows the same simple steps and need not take very long at all. At LINAR we recommend the TNT method:\n•\tTarget: on the day before the event get hold of a copy of the attendee list. Identify at least five people you want to speak to. Think about each conversation and what you want to get out of it. This could be as simple as putting a face to a name in the industry, a discussion on a work topic or the fact that you’ve been stood on the same hockey sidelines watching your daughter’s for three year’s but have only just twigged you’re in the same industry!  \n•\tNews: make sure you spend five mins on the day of the event getting up to speed on the major news items from around the world. Guaranteed that at some point during the event you’ll be asked for your view on something macro related – so make sure you have one!\n•\tTopics: are there any major industry developments you need to be across? A public consultation? A big regulatory change? A landmark decision? A significant industry transaction? Again, make sure you’re across the details so that you at least have (1) and understanding of what people at the event are talking about and (2) a view on the subject. \nGetting into the conversation:\nSo, you’re there. In the room. By yourself. And EVERYONE is part of a group already! No problem. Take a breath and look for a group containing one of your targets. Walk up with a friendly smile and open body language. Look for a moment when there's a pause in the discussion or when someone makes eye contact with you. Now you’re in, you have options:\n•\tListen: just because you’ve entered the group doesn’t mean you have to make a killer comment or come up with a conversation topic straight away. After introducing yourself it’s sometimes best just to listen to the ongoing conversation, get yourself comfortable and find an appropriate time for the options listed below.\n•\tOffer a comment/topic: giving yourself time to gauge the flow of conversation by listening will allow you to pinpoint when it’s best to offer a thought or comment on the conversation topic.    \nGetting out of the conversation:\nWahey. Things are going well. You’re not standing on your own and are now in a group conversation with one of your targets. Well done. Problem is, you’ve now been in the same conversation for 20 mins and there are other people you want to talk to. You’re stuck!  \nAgain, don’t panic. Remember, everyone at the event knows it’s a networking function and expects to move around just like you are doing. When it's time to move on to speak with someone else, find a natural transition point in the conversation, such as after making a relevant comment or responding to a question. Excuse yourself using something like \"It's been great talking with you about [topic], but I see someone I've been wanting to catch up with.\"  Make sure you use the opportunity to create a follow up action. Say something like “Would love to continue the conversation on [topic]. Can I grab your details and buy you a coffee next week?”.\n  \n\n\n\n\n \n26/02/24 – the cross fit cross-sell edition\nAsk any BD professional, group head, principal or managing partner for their top three wishes if they could wave a magic wand over the sales and marketing efforts of their firm and cross-selling will come first or second. Every single time. Why? Because tens of millions of £££’s are left on the physical and/or virtual table EVERY SINGLE DAY due to loss opportunities in an area of specialisation that is not your own.\nFMCG companies like Apple and Amazon are brilliant at cross selling. Just think about the Amazon checkout process and the way in which you’re encouraged to consider additional items other customers bought.  Ryanair and McDonald’s equally good. Book a Ryanair flight and you’ll be offered insurance, hotels and care hire as part of the buying process. \nLaw firms and accountants – not so much. \nThis weeks Three Things focuses on the key ingredients required to master the cross or up sell. Enjoy.\nUnderstand your customer\nDon’t attempt to sell a service to someone that they don’t want to buy. Sounds obvious, right? To cross-sell effectively you need to spend time and effort understanding your customer’s business, not just the small part or business unit that you’re currently working on.\nHow do you achieve this? By being curious (one of these most critical but underutilised skills in professional services - see recent post from top recruiter Seldon Rosser on the topic here) and asking loads of questions. For example:\n•\tThat’s interesting, tell me more about that? \n•\tHow does the transaction we’re on sit within the company’s growth roadmap? \n•\tI noticed your latest press release on [insert relevant topic here] – what doe that mean for you/your team/your company?\nAny useful cross-selling endeavour should have a tangible thread back to a need or preference that has been indicated by the customer.     \nIdentify your key cross sells\nTake a look at what you worked on last year. Did your clients regularly require additional advice outside of your area of expertise? What were they? Now look forward to this year. Are there new regulations and/or technologies that your current clients are going to be impacted by? If so, who within your firm is the expert? Build yourself a map of complementary and analogous services your client base will need and then…….know enough about them to be dangerous!\nKnow enough to be dangerous\nWe keep moving forward, opening new doors, and doing new things, because we're curious and curiosity keeps leading us down new paths.\nWalt Disney\nOnce you’ve identified your key cross sells it’s time to do some homework. Go and speak to your colleagues with the additional expertise your clients are seeking and get them to give you a crash course in their world. Develop just enough knowledge in their area to be dangerous – that is, to sound to the client like you know what you’re talking about! However, never overstep your capabilities – your aim here is to secure an intro or conversation with your colleague and, you guessed it, cross sell their expertise.\n \n04/03/24 – The price is right?\nI was speaking to my good friend, Verity Jackson-Grant, last week about pricing. As head of Simmons & Simmons pricing team, she knows more than most about the pressures involved in getting to the right price. Dealing with increasingly well informed and sophisticated buyers and procurement teams, the need to deliver innovative pricing solutions at a healthy profit margin has never been greater.\nBut what is the right price and how do you get there? Another contact once told me that the right price is one that feels fair to both the service provider and the customer. Both parties need to feel like they are getting value from the transaction.\nThis week’s Three Things provides tips and tricks from Verity and the LINAR team on how to price effectively. Enjoy.\nKnow what you’re pricing\n•\tWhat does the pitch/mandate involve? Is it a competitive tender? What’s the size of the prize? Is the customer after a final price or just an estimate? Can the mandate/pitch be split into stages and each stage priced differently?\n•\tIf you’re pricing a matter, find out as much detail as you can and, if that’s not possible, make and state your assumptions. Otherwise, your client might compare your apples with someone else’s pears. \n•\tUnderstand your client’s fee objectives and tailor your pricing accordingly – is cost a driver? Is the work BAU or strategically important? Is there an urgency? The answers may change depending on the work. \n Think about how you’re pricing\n•\tWhilst it may feel like the hourly rate is dying at a snail’s pace, consider offering alternative fee arrangements. People like choice, even if they then stick to the most traditional option. Additional choice also provides you with a higher probability of success compared to the competition.\n•\tIf you can offer a choice regarding the level of service, speed or the tasks involved (such as a Bronze, Silver & Gold option) it will help the client to see how your pricing can flex to fit their fee objectives. \nDon’t shy away from the negotiating table\n•\tPrepare for the possibility the client will say “We’d like to use you but the price is too high”? See it as an opportunity. In this instance, ask first why they’d like to use you and then use the answers to reaffirm why the price is reasonable.\n•\tDon’t mindlessly knock off another 5%. You’ll have heard the rule of negotiating in 1s not 5s, but you can also explain why you have set your price at the level you have or negotiate on the scope of the work. Run through the scope with the client and work out whether there is anything that can be removed to reduce the price. \n•\tWhilst there can be reasons for offering very low prices (buying the experience, reputational value of the work etc.), most work needs to be profitable (if you want your business to survive). Give yourself a price floor and be prepared to walk away. If you do want to offer a low price then please, please, please tell the customer why you are offering to work at that price (e.g. you’re trying to displace the incumbent and have committed your own time and resources into learning the business). Signposting this early will alert the customer early that this is a one time off and not the starting price for all future mandates of a similar nature.\n\n \n11/03/24 – the follow up \nHow many of your proposals are currently in the “pending” or “awaiting outcome” category? How many of your recent email marketing campaigns are a single, hit & hope email? At the last webinar/ in-person event you hosted, did you engage with every attendee post session to qualify them for a potential sales opportunity?\nIn our experience, across professional services, most of the time and effort in any sales or marketing campaign is focused on content creation and getting to launch. Relatively less thought is given to following up with those people that have shown interest (a qualified lead) in what you are pushing out. If follow up happens, it is haphazard, mainly manual, and rarely tracked.\nAt LINAR, we find this, how can I put it, BONKERS! The stats below show that, without follow up, the effort you put into your lead generation efforts are significantly diminished. Money is literally being left on the table.\nGood news though! Add a little discipline to a healthy dose of resilience and you can watch your conversions skyrocket. This week’s Three Things provides simple and powerful ways to follow up effectively. \nFollow up is expected\n“I don’t want to disturb them”. \n“If they were interested, they would have responded already”. \n“I don’t want to come across as desperate”. \nThe above quotes are regularly cited by professionals as reasons for not following up. What they represent are an inherent fear of failure – the “I’d rather not know than get bad news” mentality. If you’re in this category, or work with/for people that regularly use these excuses – here are some truths it would be useful to remember:\n•\tAccording to Statista, the average professional receives 120 emails per day. Thinking that your elegantly crafted marketing email will instantly cut through their overcrowded inbox is wrong, it may be the case they have simply missed or forgotten to respond. Follow up is often required as a reminder to a missed action by your target customer.\n•\tIf you don’t follow up, your competitors will. The market for professional services is saturated. You’ve done an excellent job attracting interest through your marketing campaign – to not follow up is akin to watching potential revenue walk out of the door.\nGet into a routine\nNotwithstanding the fear of failure point made above, the overwhelming reason for a lack of follow up is forgetfulness and workload. Follow up gets put on the bottom of the to do list or is lost in the inbox and never gets actioned. To ensure follow up happens, try the following:\n•\tSet aside a regular time (15-20 mins) every day to follow up. Personally, this is a first thing in the morning thing for me but other people I know block time out at the end of each day to action the day’s follow ups.\n•\tUse reminders: flag emails for action or create a “follow up required” folder in your inbox. For those of you lucky enough to have a PA, train them to conduct basic follow on your behalf to maintain momentum on opportunities. For larger campaigns, speak with your marketing colleagues/teams about automated follow up using marketing automation. \nBuild yourself a follow up bank\nA lot of follow up is repeatable, slightly monotonous and consistent. Whilst effective follow up needs to be personalised and tailored to the individual, creating baseplate text for the most common follow ups makes the follow up process much more efficient. I use Quick Parts in Microsoft Word to make things even quicker. Here’s a few examples to get your follow up bank started:\nHi xxxxx\nHope you’re well. I wanted to get in touch about the proposal we submitted on [insert topic] and understand where you are in your decision-making process. Happy to answer any questions you have on the proposal.\nI look forward to hearing from you. \n\nXxxxx\nThanks for joining us yesterday at [insert event/webinar]. How did you find the session? Were there any points that particularly resonated? If there’s any further detail you need or other questions that have been raised following the session, I’d be very happy to setup a follow up call.\nI look forward to hearing from you. \n \n18/03/24 - Business trips\nThe world of business travel has changed irrevocably following the Covid pandemic. Increased use and familiarity of platforms such as Zoom, Slack, MS Teams etc has made the world even smaller, and nowadays virtual collaboration across borders is a daily BAU activity. Layer on top of this heightened scrutiny of an organisation’s carbon footprint (for most professional services firms this can be largely bucketed into premises and travel) and the business case and associated ROI on any planned business trip needs to be watertight to gain budget holders approval.\nNotwithstanding the above, at LINAR we believe that well structured business travel can still deliver significant benefits to an organisation that a Teams/Zoom hookup never will. \nAs we’re travelling overseas this week on a client engagement, we’ve dedicated Three Things to tips and tricks on how to get the most from your travels. Enjoy.\nDo the hard work up front\n•\tObjective setting: what's the purpose of your trip? Fact finding in a new market? Key client engagement? Team integration? Issue management with key account? Whatever the purpose (and there may be multiple), define your criteria for what a successful trip outcome looks like and plan your schedule accordingly. At the end of your trip make time to review and ensure you achieved your objectives.\n•\tMind your P’s & Q’s: spend time to research and understand cultural norms in the jurisdiction you are visiting. What is the meeting etiquette? Formal or over lunch/drinks? Is there a strong business hierarchy that must be observed? What is the most appropriate business greeting? Being insensitive or ignoring local customs is one of the best ways to make your trip unsuccessful. If in doubt, ask your colleagues.\n•\tMaximise your network: engage with colleagues and clients as early as possible to identify what benefit your trip can bring to them. For example, are there new regulations occurring in your home jurisdiction which have extraterritorial reach? Would a market update to colleagues enable them to be more informed when talking to their clients about global issues? Once your topic list/talking points have been agreed, support your international colleagues in reaching out to their wider client network by providing them with a summary of why their clients should take a meeting with them/you. Turn this summary into a LinkedIn post and broadcast to your social network.\nLimit your screen time\nThere is no point in travelling to another office/country and then proceeding to fill your diary with back to back virtual calls. Your trip should focus on building rapport and interaction with your team/clients in a way that cannot be achieved via virtual means. Consider the following:\n•\tClient engagement: for individual client meetings, ask the client to introduce members of their team you don’t know and present to you on their plans. Consider whether there is the opportunity to bring clients together for a workshop/roundtable/event and gain the halo effect of convening the activity. If you’re travelling to attend a conference, book a meeting room in the conference hotel and organise a series of meetings around the conference schedule.\n•\tTeam building: make a conscious effort to get to know team members and other colleagues on a personal level. Find common ground and shared interests – where possible, spend time outside of the office building rapport. Use the face to face opportunity to discuss optimal ways of working and to tackle frustrations and challenges that could otherwise remain hidden behind a screen.\nThe work starts when you land \nAs with most all sales related activities, prompt and effective follow up is a critical component of success. Commitments made during your business trip to colleagues and clients alike need to be actioned within one week of your return.  Write a trip report with key notes from your client meetings and agreed team actions. Send to your budget holders to demonstrate ROI (it makes obtaining budget for the next trip MUCH easier) and to your team to keep yourself honest.\n \n26/03/24 - Feedback \nKids are brilliant at it. Only recently did my four year old tell me I need to go for a run as my tummy was getting too big. The elderly are also quite adept at it. Many years ago, I can remember my grandma commenting on a new haircut. “Why have you done that to yourself (shaved your head)? You look like an over-inflated football”. Retail and consumer businesses are constantly seeking feedback in order to improve their offerings. Trip Advisor has built a business out of customer reviews.\nSo why, in professional services, are large numbers of firms and individuals within those firms, still reticent to seek feedback from their paying customers?\nIn this instalment of Three Things, we look at overcoming some of the common reasons provided for not asking for feedback and demonstrating the power that continual customer feedback can provide to an organisation. Enjoy. \nExcuse 1: “They are busy people. I don’t want to waste their time”.\nYou’re 100% right. People are very busy. That’s why, when you demonstrate you want to improve service delivery through feedback, they will likely bite your arm off to participate. A feedback session with you may allow your customer a small window of opportunity to reflect on the service(s) being provided, not only by your firm but also other suppliers.\nFeedback can also be gathered in increasingly efficient ways. It’s worth asking your customer how they best want to deliver their feedback. Face to face? Zoom call? Quick survey (MS Forms, Typeform or similar)?  \nExcuse 2: “I have a great relationship with [client name]. If there was something wrong,  I’d know about it”.\nNot necessarily in our experience and definitely not if the something wrong is you! Similar to personal relationships, business relationships can ebb and flow over time. Customer organisations and the people within them can change meaning that a previously strong chemistry can become diluted. Many people find giving constructive feedback to an individual they are working with hard and so duck the situation, or worse, find an alternate supplier.\nProviding an independent feedback mechanism allows the customer to feel comfortable in speaking with someone who is removed from service delivery. It also removes the tendency for the doer to concentrate feedback solely on their specific area of specialism rather than the entirety of the relationship.   \nExcuse 3: “What if the feedback is bad”?\nPeople rarely voice this excuse as it is written above. However, in our view, this is the single greatest unspoken barrier to asking for feedback. And yet, it also happens to be the most important reason for conducting feedback at all.\nFirstly, we’re assuming that the feedback will be bad. However, what if it’s good? Or excellent? Feedback has the ability to really boost your brand through the use of public review tools and/or customer testimonials. But, as the old saying goes, “If you don’t ask, you don’t get”.\nSecondly, if the feedback is bad then at least you’ve caught it early and can take steps to remediate the situation rather than lose the customer to a competitor. In our experience, customer frustrations are usually minor and can be fixed with a little focused effort.\nFinally, once the feedback has been received and actioned, watch your relationship grow and blossom with your customers. Why? Because you’ve demonstrated that you care. It’s as simple as that.\n--------------------------------------------   \n\nIf you’re reading this edition of Three Things, it’s likely you work in a people oriented service industry. On a daily basis, you’ll be interacting with you clients (both internal and external), managing teams and multiple competing deadlines to deliver the very best service you can on behalf of your organisation.\nNo one doubts that. However, the fantastic and somewhat challenging nature of the business we’re in is controlling the quality and consistency of outputs delivered to your customers.    \n\nQuantitative vs qualitative \nSpeak to most professional services firms about feedback and they will likely start by telling you about their (recently established) key client feedback programme, the in depth interviews conducted by their BD teams and the rich data set this creates. However, ask them what their NPS score is across their client book and you will frequently receive a shrug followed by a quiet “no idea”.\nWhen devising your approach to customer feedback consideration should be given to both qualitative and quantitative measurements so that your feedback can be tangibly measured and compared in a scalable manner as your business grows. \nTypes of feedback can be segmented based on customer segmentation. For example, qualitative in person feedback sessions for your top 20 clients is not only incredibly useful but also signposts to these clients that they are important to you. \nQuantitative feedback loops deployed at scale can also be incredibly useful in helping a firm to understand improvements required.  \nThe approach taken by most professional services firms to customer feedback concentrates on a tiny proportion of the firms client base and can be time consuming and costly. The qualitative nature of the feedback can be extremely useful for account  \nWhat to measure\nWhen building a customer feedback tool it is useful to first map each stage in the customer lifecycle and then work out how to measure customer satisfaction at each of these stages.  The diagram below provides some thoughts on measurements associated with each main stage of the customer lifecycle.\n•\tClient acquisition\no\tTime to onboard\no\tVariation in standard terms\no\tDiscount required to standard rates\n\nActing on feedback\n\n\n \nFamily edition – 08/04/24\nSales is in my blood. Growing up, Dad was always buying and selling stuff. By the age of 18, we’d lived in 17 different houses. I have vivid memories of sitting at the breakfast table discussing all manner of business before school.\nDuring a family holiday last week in Kinsale, Ireland, I asked members of the family for their top sales and BD tips during their respective careers.\nSo, here it is. Three Things this week is sponsored by The Curtis family. Enjoy.\nPreparation is key\nMy brother in law is a massive banker. Yes, you read that right – he’s 6’4”. He works for a high street name in financial services and spends his days structuring multi-million pound transactions for customers who trust him with a lot of money. \nHis top tip is prepare, prepare, prepare. And then prepare some more. Doing the hard yards up front, by conducting thorough research on your target customers and the opportunity you are chasing, will put you in good shape for that initial meeting and ensure you leave a good impression. Walking through potential objections to your pitch and rehearsing answers can demonstrate to your targets that you not only understand your own offering but also how it applies to your target’s organisation.  \nPersonal touch\nMy sister has been hugely successful in a completely different industry – food. She’s sold chocolate to corner shops and now runs a multi-million pound frozen vegetable business supplying major supermarkets across the UK & Ireland. Her top tip is simple – make it personal.\nIn her business, she faces a lot of competition. To differentiate herself, she makes an effort to get to know her key customers on a personal level. She remembers kids and spouse names, birthdays, where someone went on holiday, which football team they support etc. Building up this level of knowledge takes time and discipline but sprinkling this information throughout your sales conversations adds a layer of intimacy and personal interaction that will be remembered.\nStorytelling\nMy other half has worked at major events and conferences across Thailand, Hong Kong and London. A key part of her role involves securing sponsors and so she’s adept at getting people to part with their money! \nHer top tip is also one of my favourites – sell through storytelling. Since time began, people have used stories to captivate audiences and help people to remember crucial information. Nursery rhymes and fairytales are prime examples of stories that help people to remember key facts.\nIn a sales context, stories can bring facts, figures and features to life and can help people to visualise what an end solution might look and feel like. They also take a conversation from transactional to emotional – moving the buying decision to include more human factors including trust, empathy and loyalty.\nLike stories, case studies can prove very powerful in demonstrating how, in practical terms, a product or service operates in real life.  \n15/04/24 – The Pipeline edition\nAs a new financial year looms for a lot of professional services firms, two activities occur concurrently. Bills for Work In Progress (WIP) or, in some cases, work completed long ago but not billed, are quickly checked and sent to the client prior to April 30. At the same time, budgets for the new financial year are calculated and sent to department heads, bizarrely (in our view) based on the available number of billable hours available.\nDiscussions around market opportunities and how to capture the interest of customers in relation to these opportunities is, in our experience, somewhat lacking. This makes the development of a sales pipeline, a tool designed to focus attention on what is important, very difficult.\nThis week we’ve picked out three aspects of the sales pipeline you should consider when heading into FY24/25. Enjoy. \nEyeballs are EVERYTHING\nThe sales funnel is a reasonably simple concept to grasp. Lots and lots of opportunities at the top of hopper should, if the pipeline is managed well, lead to sales. The exact number of sales will be defined by how good you are at nurturing your leads through each stage of the funnel (your conversion rate). If you are launching a service/product/initiative in the new financial year and want to understand what this might look like from a sales pipeline perspective, try out the free Sales Funnel Calculator from close.com. We’ve found this useful from a planning perspective and also when convincing non-marketing professionals for the need for budgets for launch campaigns!  \nWithout lots of opportunities (eyeballs) constantly pouring into the top of the hopper, you can forget about meaningful sales. This is why the marketing and creative design department should be every salesperson’s best friend. Their ability to create eye catching and engaging content that turns a member of the public into a Marketing Qualified Lead (MQL) is a critical first stage in the sales process. So, get cosy with your marketing colleagues as they are key to your future success.  \nBe relentless \nConsidering that, on average, 2-8% of aware parties convert to engaged, it stands to reason that Considering that, on average, 2-8% of aware parties convert to engaged, it stands to reason that EVERY effort should be made to push these precious few MQL leads further down the sales funnel, And yet, in most professional services firms we speak to, there is no defined or understood process for when a lead is generated (from any channel). From the moment someone moves from aware to engaged, you have 24hrs or less to develop this engagement. Otherwise, your lead will look elsewhere. When asked about enquiry management, the common answers (and challenges associated with these answers) received from firm’s include:\n effort should be made to push these precious few MQL leads further down the sales funnel, And yet, in most professional services firms we speak to, there is no defined or understood process for when a lead is generated (from any channel). From the moment someone moves from aware to engaged, you have 24hrs or less to develop this engagement. Otherwise, your lead will look elsewhere. When asked about enquiry management, the common answers (and challenges associated with these answers) received from firm’s include:\n\n\nAnswer\tChallenge\n“Partner X (busiest and most senior partner in the group) receives all responses”\tThis approach is not practical. Efficient, or cost effective. Their role should not be to qualify leads. Consider giving this to a more junior member of the team (great development opportunity).\n“Marketing pick up all website enquiries…”\tGiven the breadth they have to cover, it is unlikely the marketing team with have sufficient depth of knowledge to qualify a lead. See above for solution.\n“We’ve set up a distribution list for all responses…”\tAt LINAR we call this the TEFLON ™ approach. Everyone in the distribution list believes that everyone else in the distribution list will pick up the enquiry and so no does! Identify 1/2 people max to qualify leads in a timely manner.\n\nThe common result of a lack of process is leakage (your funnel turns to a sieve) between Awareness & Engagement. Put another way, all that time and effort invested by you and your marketing team in developing a sh^t hot campaign, combined with the pain of convincing your lawyer/accountant/engineering colleagues for a meagre advertising and launch spend, is wasted because you’re losing a proportion of the precious leads you’ve fought so hard to won. \nSo please, please, please, if you remember one thing from this email today, define your process for enquiry management and follow EVERY SINGLE LEAD up as it may result in a sale.\nA non-response does not mean “no”\nHere’s some top line sales stats for you from the team at Hubspot. \n[sales stats]\nWe’ve spoken previously about the excuses given for not following up on a lead. “Don’t want to disturb them.” “Don’t want to look desperate.” “If they were interested, they would have responded already”. And my personal favourite, “I don’t want to come across as salesy!”  These excuses demonstrate a lack of resilience and confidence in the sales process, which, let’s face it, has more rejections than wins.\nThe key here is to persevere. At LINAR Consulting we chase down EVERY lead to one of two conclusions:\n•\tI’m buying what you’re selling. Wahey! High fives all round; or\n•\tI’m not buying what you’re selling. OK. Let’s (i) understand the reason why and (ii) put you on the list for a catch up in six months when your situation might have changed.\n \n22/04/24 – Sales vs. BD vs. Marketing\nMarketing & BD Manager, Marketing & BD Executive, Senior BD & Marketing Advisor, Content and Communications Manager, Sales & Relationship Development Manager, Pitch and Pursuits Manager, Senior Client Relationship Manager, Strategic Pitch Manager \nI could go on……\nAbove are a selection of current vacancies posted on professional services recruitment websites. Somewhere in the previous 5-10 years, fueled , I think, by a lack of appetite by firm management to adequately resource the BD & Marketing functions, the distinct, but inextricably linked, skills possessed by marketing and business development professionals have become merged into hybrid generalist roles which cover simply too much ground for any one person. \nThe saga continues. In the past few years, firms that have woken up to sales professionals are now trying to respray their BD & Marketing team members into high performing sales folk, (usually with a woefully inadequate incentive scheme - that’s an edition for another day)!\nThe result? An overall decrease in specialist skill sets required to add value to a firm and a lack of clarity between the various teams as to where they fit in the sales pipeline. \nBefore Three Things embarks on a five-part series around the ultimate sales campaigns next week, we thought it would be useful to provide our thoughts on these three specialist skill sets and how they need to work harmoniously together in order to deliver revenue. Enjoy.\nMarketing \nWe’ve said it before and we’ll keep saying it. In sales, without leads, you’re dead. Filling the top of the sales funnel is a critical first step in any sales methodology. With only 2-8% of aware leads becoming engaged, you need A LOT of leads in the top of your funnel. Enter, the marketing team! Housing a selection of specialists from the creative genius who converts your sh^t description into a powerful infographic, or the SEO guru who, with a rewrite of your sales copy, can magically send you up the rankings, this team will develop a shop window that will attract your potential customers. \nIn our experience, marketeers work best when they are involved from the very outset of a sales campaign. To make the most of their unique skillset, careful thought is required on the key sales messages, buyer personas and target market(s) to allow these creative folk to build you a compelling platform. Creativity also takes time, so allow plenty for a premium shop window.\nSuperpowers include creativity, interpreting stream of consciousness thinking and turning around work within ridiculous timeframes.\nBusiness Development (BD)\nA competent BD professional is worth their weight in gold to a salesperson. Why? Because they know EVERYTHING there is to know about a service line (practice group), sector or client. BD teams spend their days immersed in important information flows on industry trends, client pain points and competitor intelligence. They have responsibility for executing the Go To Market (GTM) strategy for their area/client and can provide valuable information and guidance on how sales campaigns will land. They are adept at spotting opportunities and building long-term relationships with key clients of the firm. \nSuperpowers include strategic planning, ego massaging and finding budget when there isn’t any.\nSales \nUnlike BD professionals, the sales team will likely have a wide portfolio of firmwide services & products under its remit. Their Total Addressable Market (TAR) will be different for each product or service but will likely be split between existing clients (those that the BD teams cannot service due to capacity) and new client acquisition. The sales team works on volume (developed by the marketing team) and conversion (enhanced by intelligence provided by the BD teams). \nSuperpowers include resilience, perseverance and optimism.       \nv=spf1 include:spf.protection.outlook.com -all \n29/04/24 - Sales Campaigns (Part 1) - Campaign preparation\nSales don’t just happen. In a digital age, where information and comparison tools are at your fingertips, the buyer is very much in command of any purchasing process. Now, more than ever, the seller has to work hard to create a compelling sales proposition which is tailored to client needs AND sufficiently differentiated from the competitor product or service.\nAs discussed last week, an effective sales campaign requires a combination of marketing, Subject Matter Expertise (SME), business development and sales skills to generate revenue. Historically, professional services firms have concentrated too much on the awareness end of the sales funnel, piling time and resources into content led marketing initiatives with no clear line of sight to sales and revenue. They have neglected the bottom half of the funnel, resulting in leads being neglected or lost, conversion rates being lower and ultimately, revenue levels being lower than hoped for.\nOver the next five weeks, Three Things is going to break down each stage of the sales funnel and provide our thoughts, ideas and suggestions on ways in which you can turn your existing campaigns into effective revenue generation powerhouses. Let’s start at the beginning with campaign preparation. Enjoy.\nAddressable market\nTo understand the revenue potential of your product or service, spend some time working out your TAR, SAM and SOM. No, it’s not a Vietnamese dish. If these acronyms are new to you, the diagram below and descriptions here will help (thanks Hubspot). \nMost professional services firms we work with market to their own CRM database (always, in our experience, patchy from a data perspective), which is likely to represent only a fraction of the SOM. As you can see, firms are missing out on significant revenue opportunities if they narrow their focus to their existing client contacts. Channels such as Google and LinkedIn are opening up huge markets via digital advertising and firms should lean into these channels to broaden their marketing activities.    \nBuyer persona \nWhen I was first asked to create a buyer persona by the marketing team, I rolled my eyes and thought “What a waste of time”. I was wrong. Buyer personas are a critical tool in ensuring that your sales and marketing messages speak directly to your potential customers. A buyer persona need not be a long, drawn out process. However, the process itself should result in a very clear and tangible picture of who your buyer is, what job they do, where they are located, how best to communicate with them and, importantly, how the product or service you are providing will help to solve their problem(s). The buyer persona is a live document that is constantly refined and updated based on experiences with your target customers. \nThe team at AWeber have pulled together some great tips on building simple buyer personas, summarised well in the diagram below. \nMarket testing\nA guaranteed mechanism for your new product or service to spectacularly fail is to launch it to your target market without having first enlisted some feedback from a market testing exercise. Marketing testing is a fantastic opportunity to test your proposition with longstanding, friendly clients and, done well, can strengthen your client relationships whilst also creating some pre-launch interest in the offering. Additional features and ideas may also be generated during this phase which have not previously been considered. Service features, pricing structure, marketing approach (packaging) are all areas that can be reviewed in the market testing phase. For certain types of product or service, focus groups can also be established to gain feedback on the offering and what resonates most from the proposition. When conducting your market testing exercise, ensure you also review your buyer persona and refine where appropriate to focus your launch activities. \n06/05/24 - Sales Campaigns (Part 2) - Awareness (Top of funnel)\nLast week we looked at TAM, SOM, SAM and defined WHO might buy what we’re selling using buyer personas and market testing. A good start. However, without a compelling and well thought through proposition, we might as well all go home. Building a differentiated service or product strategy will be critical to generating sales. If you’re struggling with where to start, have a chat with Pete Byre @ digital whiskey or Jamie Hockin, both of whom are big fish in this space. \nLet’s take the plunge into the top of the sales funnel and the AWARENESS stage. This week we’re diving into HOW to reel those buyers in using the right bait and hooks. Can anyone else smell something fishy? Enjoy.    \nNet or rod?\nThere are a plethora of channels available to you when building market awareness for your offering. Which channel(s) you use depends on what you are trying to sell and which part of your Service Obtainable Market (SOM) you’re trying to attract. We find it useful to break your channel selection into three:\n•\tOwned Channels: Your website, blog, social media profiles, and email newsletters are your trusty, well used nets. They offer consistent exposure to your existing audience and help position your brand as a leader.\n•\tEarned Channels: PR, guest articles and media mentions serve as fishing rods that help you reach a broader audience, likely to be outside of your current CRM. Your reputation hooks new prospects.\n•\tPaid Channels: Paid ads, sponsorships, and promoted posts cast a wider net over your ideal audience, ensuring your brand gets noticed by prospects you haven't yet reached.\nUse a mix of channels to diversify your approach. For instance, leverage owned channels for consistent messaging with existing clients, earned channels to establish credibility with new targets, and paid channels to broaden your reach outside of your CRM system.\nBait the Hook\nCompelling content delivered through the right channels will attract many, many fish. Some tried and tested bait options to consider when you’re building out your content:\n•\tTake a view: offer your perspective on market events, landmark deals, regulatory changes, or court decisions relevant to your clients' sectors. Don't just summarize (that’s what everyone else will do) – take a stance and be prepared to defend it.\n•\tKeep It Short & Speedy (KISS): hook your reader within 15 seconds with punchy, digestible insights. Leave the weightier articles for journals, and stay focused on practical takeaways for your audience.\n  \n•\tRepeat & Reuse: maximise your reach by tailoring it for multiple platforms. Publish an impact statement on LinkedIn, share a personal message via email, and pitch your position to the media. Extract every single piece of value out of the content you created.\nAlign your bait with your channels. For existing clients, email content directly with personalised impact notes. For new clients, use ads and LinkedIn posts to cast a wider net or fish in a different spot.\nHook the Catch\nA hook without bait will catch no fish, and bait without a hook won't convert leads into clients. Make sure your Calls To Action (CTAs) are visible, relevant, and irresistible:\n•\tSingle Hook: focus on one clear CTA per piece of content – a downloadable guide, a sign-up form, or a free consultation offer.\n•\tMultiple Hooks: for deeper content like webinars or reports, provide multiple hooks, like scheduling a call, subscribing to a newsletter, or joining a networking event.\n•\tFollow-Up Hook: send a quick follow-up email after they bite (if you take more than 24hrs to respond – forget it), thanking them and offering additional resources. Reel them in with value-added calls to action that build curiosity and trust. Follow up with a mix of email, social media, and phone calls to ensure your message lands. Build a \"follow-up bank\" of templated emails for common scenarios. Quick Parts in Microsoft Word can help make your follow-up faster and more efficient.\nReady to Fish?\nGet out there and cast your net or rod over your brand-building channels, bait the hook with compelling content, and reel them in with irresistible CTAs. Remember, your potential market is vast, so make sure your net is strong and your bait is tempting.\n\n \n20/05/24 - Sales Campaigns (Part 3) - Engagement\nAfter a week off (Bordeaux – lovely – thanks for asking), this week we are continuing our journey down the sales funnel and entering the world of engagement. The team in Awareness have been working tirelessly to hook leads left, right and centre. You have a bunch of Marketing Qualified Leads (MQL) with a registered interest in your product/service and now it’s time to nurture and caress these folk further into your product or service web. Below are some tactics that work for us. Happy spinning! \n1. Consistent and structured lead engagement process\nWhere do your web enquiries go? On a CTA, who is responsible for the initial response? How many times have you run a campaign in the past where the contact point was the really busy partner with a history of responding when “the client work” is done?\nTo effectively engage leads, it's crucial to define a consistent and structured process, regardless of the channel the lead originates from. This ensures that every lead is treated with the same level of importance and that no potential opportunity slips through the cracks. Our tips:\n•\tStandardise communication: Develop a set of templates for initial contact, follow-ups, and nurturing emails that can be customised as needed. This will help maintain a consistent tone and message and increase the speed of response. \n•\tAssign responsibility: if automation is not currently an option within your firm (see below), identify a point person with the capacity, templates (see above) and knowledge to deal with the initial response. Have a backup in case this individual is Out Of Office BUT DO NOT create a distribution list for potential respondees as the only thing that happens is that everyone else thinks it’s being picked up by you and vice versa!\n•\tUse a CRM System: Implement a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system to track all interactions with leads. This will ensure that all team members are informed about the status and history of each lead. LINAR uses HubSpot (very good) and team members have previously used PipeDrive (also very good). For larger organisations, it’s worth looking and DealCloud and Salesforce. REMEMBER the golden rule of CRM – sh^t in = sh^t out!\n2. Timing is Everything\nBe honest with yourself. How long, on average, does it take for your firm to respond once a lead has been generated? Within the hour? Punchy. Within 24hrs? I suspect most professional services firms would be happy with this? Don’t know because you don’t track response times? Get a grip! We’re in 2024. \n[INSERT IMAGES]\n\nAs you can see from the graphics above and below, responding to leads promptly can significantly increase your chances of conversion. Here are some quick tips to help you start increasing your response time. \n•\tMeasure them! You cannot improve if you don’t have a baseline to compare to. Use your CRM to monitor response times and identify any delays. Set performance goals for your team to ensure timely engagement with all leads.\n•\tAutomate initial responses: Human teams who have other work tasks, need sleep and regular toilet stops cannot hit the response times we’re talking about above, especially if your coverage transcends time zones. Use automated tools to send an immediate acknowledgment email or message to leads, letting them know that you will be in touch shortly.\n•\tMake it easy: In today's fast-paced world, convenience is king. To keep your leads engaged, make interacting with you as effortless as possible. Make sure your follow up comms is clear and concise, use online scheduling tools like MS Bookings or Calendly and ensure everything is mobile-friendly. \n3. Keeping the Flame Alive\nSo, you’ve hooked your lead with a lightning-fast response. Congratulations! But now, how do you keep the romance alive? You don’t want your lead to feel like you’re the dating equivalent of a one-hit wonder. Here’s how to keep them engaged and interested:\n•\tDon’t Be a One-Message Wonder: Just like in dating, nobody likes a ghost. Keep the conversation going with regular follow-ups. But beware, there’s a fine line between attentive and stalker. Aim for thoughtful, valuable content that keeps them coming back for more.\n•\tOffer Value, Not Spam: Send them useful information, tips, and resources related to their interests and needs. No one wants to be spammed with sales pitches. Think of it as sending flowers, not junk mail.\n•\tShow Them a Good Time: Invite them to webinars, live demos, or exclusive events. Give them a taste of the VIP treatment. They’ll appreciate the personal touch and remember why they swiped right on you in the first place. \n28/05/24 - Sales Campaigns (Part 4) – Opportunity knocks…\nCongratulations! The previous two week’s have paid off. You’ve nurtured your lead to the point at which this can be counted as a fully fledged sales opportunity. By even getting to this stage in the sales funnel, you’ve increased your chances of success from 2-8% to 25-35%.  \nNow the hard work starts. It’s likely that you’ll now be required to submit some form of written proposal which clearly articulates your product/service offering and the associated fees to your target customer. You need to shape everything you’ve learned to date and mould an offering that speaks directly to your customers core needs. \nWelcome to the opportunity stage of the sales funnel. Here’s our thoughts on loading the dice in your favour. Enjoy.\nDefine the problem\nFar too many Request For Proposals (RFPs) are flicked instantly to the M&BD team who are then asked to pull something together without knowledge of the most basic requirement – understanding the customer problem or need. Unsurprisingly, a draft is developed, likely based on previous pitches, full of marketing fluff (“Our firm was established in 1896 and has offices in 23 jurisdictions”) and lengthy experience lists (“[firm name] advised [random client] on the outsourcing of their global payroll system” x 20), which add precisely no value to any proposal, ever.\nBefore committing a single word to paper, your time, and that of your M&BD team, is much better spent probing your target customer with questions* to understand:\n•\tWhat’s most important to them?\n•\tWhat are their must haves?\n•\tWhat does success looks like?\n•\tWhat is the internal decision making process? Who has ultimate signoff?\n*Many of you will be reading and thinking it’s not possible to have these conversations during a formal RFP process which involves professional procurement teams. You’re right. Which is why it is critical to have these types of conversations and nurture your contacts before any formal process is initiated. \nSolve the problem\nOnce the client problem has been clearly diagnosed, now is the time to work with your M&BD team to craft a response that provides comfort and peace of mind to your target customer that you are the ideal solution for solving their problem. Here are some techniques that work for us: \n•\tCase studies: rather than endless lists of decades old experience, concentrate on a small number of detailed case studies which directly relate to the problem you are solving for your target customer. Each case study should answer the following simple questions:\n•\tWhat was the problem?\n•\tHow did you solve it?\n•\tWhat skills and expertise can you bring from that experience that will benefit your target customer?\n•\tReferrals: proactively offer your target customer an opportunity to speak with another (preferably happy!) customer who has used you before. This provides your target with an independent view to verify the claims you are making in your proposal.\n•\tOptions: providing delivery and/or pricing options as part of your proposal increases your probability of success when in a competitive environment. How? Simple math. \n[image]\nNot only is this an effective way to load the dice in your favour, but it also demonstrates to your target customer that you are flexible in the way you can work with them.\nKY Competition\nFirst and foremost, concentrate on your solution and how it will benefit your target customer. However, a little time brainstorming your likely competition and the areas/solutions they will be pushing will help to sharpen and focus your core messaging. Things to consider include:\n•\tResourcing: do they have sufficient resources to complete the job? Have there been recent team changes? Has a key team member left?\n•\tPricing: is their price robust? are they known for low balling?  \n•\tService: are they partner led? Will they be responsive and put the A-team on the job?\nOnce the competitive landscape is understood, re read your proposal and aim to seed doubts on the competition throughout your response.\n \n03/06/24 - Sales Campaigns (Part 5) - Conversion\nSo here we are. The last mile. Over the past few weeks, we’ve defied overwhelming odds and now have a potential customer within sniffing distance of the line. The proposal last week has landed well BUT, there is still work to do. Doubts will emerge, questions will be frustrating and relentless and there will always be haggling over the price.  Remember, until there’s a signed contract, take nothing for granted. \nWelcome to the final week of deconstructing the sales cycle. Stay calm, stay cool and enjoy the adrenaline that comes with the all important conversion stage. Here’s our Three top tips for victory.\nPerseverance\nIt’s hard work to get a customer to part with their money. Doubt and indecision are a seller’s nightmare, creating undue delays in an already long process. And, whilst this sale might be a big deal to you, it’s likely to be one of a hundred other things on your customer’s desk.   Maintaining momentum during the conversion process is essential to securing that sale. Our tips for staying front of mind include:\n•\tFollow up, follow up, follow up: regularly check in with prospects without being overly persistent. You've earned the right to know the outcome of your work nurturing this opportunity, so be relentless in your pursuit of an answer. Use your CRM/Outlook/PA to remind you to nudge your prospect on a frequent (we recommend weekly) basis. This will help you to stay front of mind and also demonstrate your desire to win the job.\n•\tProvide ongoing value: in a sophisticated buying market, repetitive, one dimensional follow ups will not achieve your outcome. Look to share relevant content, insights, or updates that keep the conversation alive and demonstrate your ongoing commitment to helping the customer. \n•\tStay positive and persistent: maintain a positive attitude and keep the communication lines open. Sometimes, customers need more time to decide, and your continued interest can tip the scale in your favour. As the stats below prove, perseverance will keep you ahead of the competition.  \n[IMAGE]\nObjection Handling\nIt’s entirely natural for the person(s) on the other side of the deal to get nervous pre-sale. They will have to justify the cost of purchase to their bosses and will remain responsible for delivering the benefits promised way after you disappear into the sunset. \nSuccessfully navigating objections is crucial in the conversion stage. Anticipate common concerns and prepare clear, confident responses. Understand the customer's needs and pain points to address objections effectively. The following techniques work for us:\n•\tPatience: spending time with a customer can be very powerful in unlocking some of the barriers to purchase. Offer to go and see the customer at their office (or home if working remotely) and workshop their concerns with them. Your aim here is to make more effort than the competition and show the customer that you care. \n•\tEvidence and testimonials: use case studies and testimonials to provide social proof. Encourage them to re-engage with the referral contacts you provided at the opportunity stage. \n•\tBe open to alternatives: some objections may require flexibility on your side to resolve. Keep the bigger picture in mind and, to the extent that you can provide alternatives that do not materially change the core commercial components of your proposition, work with your customer to find a shared solution.\nNegotiating a Win/Win position\nNegotiation is about finding a mutually beneficial agreement where both parties feel they are getting value from the transaction. Here are some key strategies to try:\n•\tKnow your bottom line: it is your customer’s right to haggle and try and achieve the best price for their organisation. When preparing to negotiate, understand your bottom line and hold firm. DO NOT reduce your offer without first de-scoping or taking something off the table. Be open to discussion but also be prepared to walk away if the right deal cannot be reached. This is really hard to do but will pay dividends down the line as it creates integrity for your organisation’s pricing structures.\n•\tProvide options & alternatives: last week we discussed creating multiple options for your customer to increase your probability of a win. The same goes during the negotiation phase.  Understand your customer’s challenges and tailor your solution accordingly. Some common examples include:\no\tAllow milestone/staged payments instead of payment upfront.\no\tOffer a money back guarantee if the customer is not satisfied with the services provided.\no\tLink your compensation to results. This demonstrates to the customer that you have skin in the game and are confident in your/your organisation’s abilities to deliver.\nWe hope you’ve enjoyed this sales deconstruction mini-series of Three Things. Feedback is a gift – we'd love to hear yours via this 2 min survey link.\nOver the next few weeks we’ll be inviting some of our key industry colleagues operating in complementary and associated areas to share with us their thoughts on their chosen area of speciality. \n\n \n10/06/24 – Gen AI (Sam Stamp)\nConnecting people and collaborating with others are key business and life skills. The ability to make introductions and link together the various parts of your network can be hugely valuable from a sales and relationship building perspective. \nSo, for the next few weeks, Three Things is going to practice what it preaches. We’re going to be joined by a number of guest contributor’s, all of whom we know well and bring a new and exciting perspective to the world of sales and business development within professional services.  \nWho better to kick things off than the newest edition to the LINAR family, our AI lead, Sam Stamp.  Over the next few minutes, Sam’s going to explore how Generative AI (GenAI) can supercharge the drafting of cold outreach and follow up. Through the intelligent and strategic use of Large Language Models (LLMs) it’s possible to drastically speed up the rate at which you can draft effective copy. Here’s his top tips. Enjoy.\n1. Choose the Right LLM\nThere are a lot of different LLMs available for you to use, and they all have slightly different strengths and weaknesses. Understanding your specific needs is the first step in selecting the most suitable LLM for your tasks. It is also important to understand if your organisation has any particular guidelines, although this does not appear to be the norm at the moment. \n•\tResearch: If you need to gather and synthesise information, models like OpenAI’s GPT-4 are generally considered market-leading at the moment. \n•\tDrafting Messages: For crafting personalised emails or messages, tools like Jasper or Copy.ai can be more intuitive, and are designed specifically for this purpose. \n•\tBudget Considerations: Decide whether you need a premium version for advanced features or if a free, generic model suffices. Familiarise yourself with the nuances of your chosen LLM to fully leverage its capabilities, before investing in any paid versions. \n 2. Use the Right Prompts\nEffective prompting is the bedrock of any effective engagement with GenAI tools. For most LLMs (e.g. Chat-GPT, Claude, Google Gemini), they are general purpose – ready to create the ‘most likely’ answer to any question given. In order to get something more specific to your needs, you must be more specific in your request. \n•\tCraft Specific Prompts: Instead of generic queries, provide detailed instructions to guide the AI. For example, \"You are the Sales Director of a leading legal consulting firm. Please draft a sales email targeting mid-sized law firms highlighting our new AI integration service. Focus on the core benefits of immediate productivity and efficiency gains.\" (more another time on why it’s still good to say ‘please’ to an LLM!)\n•\tPrompt it again, Sam: There’s no reason you can’t ask for something to be re-written again and again and again. Each time you can add more detail or ask for further clarifications and changes. There is likely a diminishing return here though, and at some point you can take what’s there and finalise yourself. \n•\tData Privacy: Always ensure you’re not sharing sensitive or personal data in your prompts. Avoid using client-specific information that isn't publicly available. \n3. Check the Output\nLLMs generate responses based on patterns, not direct searches, so you always need to double check what you’re sharing.  This isn’t only for risk of ‘hallucinations’ (where an AI has literally just made something up simply because it is producing something that is ‘most likely to be true’) but also for tone, style and relevance. \n•\tVerify Information: Cross-check the generated content for accuracy and relevance.\n•\tUnderstand Context Windows: Be aware of how much prior conversation the LLM considers when generating responses, and ensure it includes all necessary context. For example, you may have requested certain specific language was used, but after an hour or so of crafting messages, that language may no longer being referenced. \n•\tStay Human: Remember that you are still the arbiter of what goes out with your name attached. Just because an LLM produced something at lightening pace does not mean it’s right. If you want to change some or all of it, do – sometimes it’s just the fact of not starting with a blank page that is the biggest benefit. \nIn the near future, as AI technologies advance, writing the ‘perfect’ outreach email will become standard practice. This shift means building genuine relationships and in-person interactions will become even more crucial. Allow AI to handle the routine, repetitive tasks, freeing you to focus on what truly matters—building meaningful connections.\nFor more insights and hands-on experience, join our upcoming workshops designed to help you integrate GenAI into your business processes seamlessly.

From initial negotiation to payment, disputes and chasing of debt, most professional services colleagues would likely rank this aspect of their role very low in job satisfaction terms. As a result, it is estimated that £36bn in value is lost or written off every year due to poor financial hygiene.\nWhy should you be bothered? What’s is got to do with sales? A lot. Send a bill that is twice the estimate without communicating first with the client and watch the trust and credibility aspects of The Trust Equation crumble. Work tirelessly on a massive pitch only to have the agreed bill not paid and watch your commission walk out the door.\nStefan Ciesla-Grain, co-founder at ayora.ai., and this week’s guest on the Three Things takeover, is on a mission to fix this challenge. Using proprietary AI technology combined with good old fashioned nudge theory, Stefan and his team are building a product that prompts and support busy lawyers on timely client comms to get paid quicker, with less write-offs along the way. Here’s Ayora’s Three Things to improve your financial hygiene. Enjoy.\n1 Consistent client communication\nOne of the easiest ways to increase your chances of achieving a great recovery on your time is to keep the client updated on fees throughout the matter’s lifecycle. There are a few reasons for that:\n•\tClient appreciation decays with time: this is very much a human factor. If you’re advising on a fast-paced M&A transaction, the client is more likely to truly appreciate the all-nighters your team pulled in the heat of the moment!\n•\tClients need to manage their internal budgets: clients are becoming ever more cost-conscious, and often need to go through their own internal process to get their legal budget increased. Give them heads up.\n•\tYour leverage drops to zero post-factum: say you notice that an additional piece of work is advisable halfway through a matter. By cracking on with that without notifying the client first (and agreeing scope extension) you risk not getting compensated for that commendable initiative down the line.\n2 Bill regularly and bill promptly\nAs a rule of thumb, people and organisations prefer to pay their suppliers later rather than sooner. However, there are a few caveats here!\n•\tIf you stipulate that you will bill a client at a certain point in time (be it on a regular basis or once a milestone is hit), then you should follow through. The client will probably expect your invoice and a delay in receiving that will most likely only derail their internal processes. \n•\tThe sooner you raise the bill, the more likely you are to recover your time. This is largely because of the time decay of client appreciation described above. On that note, if you don’t have to wait until your monthly cut off date, don’t. Law firms inadvertently elongate their lockup days by up to approximately 15 days due to lawyers’ propensity to bill at the last minute. That is crazy.\n•\tUnderstand your client’s priorities. If you are engaged by your client’s Treasury department, they are likely to attach some value to receiving your bill a bit later. If you are engaged by your client’s GC, they are less likely to think about the time value of your fees, and thus will probably not really appreciate your client-friendly billing practices.\n3 Know your value, and don’t be shy about it\nEvery lawyer that doesn’t feel comfortable talking about their fees should recall the Roman emperor Vespasian’s saying ‘pecunia non olet’, or ‘money does not stink’ (it was about taxing certain unpleasant commodities). This is worth bearing in mind today too. Specifically, I would caution you against:\n•\taccepting discounts too readily. Your rates are set at a certain level for a reason, and the client is talking to you for - you guessed it - the same reason. This is nuanced and there might be good reasons to discount rates, but there are equally many bad reasons to do that. \n•\tbeing too eager to offer time write-offs too soon. Use your judgement, but there is a good chance that your and your client’s perception of the value you bring might differ (in your favour).\n•\tignoring unpaid and overdue debts. Whilst it’s advisable to let your credit control colleagues lead on collections, don’t forget your word likely carries a lot of clout with your clients, and you might be able to help unlock a tricky debtor situation with a single phone call. There is nothing unsavoury about that either.\n\nFor more information on Ayora and/or to have a chat with Stefan about the tips above, get in touch here.\n\n \n24/06/24 – The Hock\nBrand marketing is not complicated, but it is important and easy to get wrong.\nThis week, Lee at LINAR, your usual host, asked me to shed three little bits of light on some of the early stages of the customer acquisition funnel. \nBriefly, so you know who I am, I’m Jamie Hockin, a Fractional CMO with experience across B2B and B2C brands managing the full conversion funnel from brand awareness through to acquisition and retention – and everything in between.\nI work with LINAR and their clients to create clarity and differentiation in their communication and brand stories. \nMarketing fluff I hear you say. Well, no. I’ll tell you for why.\nThe reason why ‘marketing’ in some companies gets a bad rap (fluff) is because many marketers overcomplicate an essentially straightforward process. They justify their existence by creating acronyms, layers of complexity, complex matrixes, unfathomable consumer journey’s that confuses their audience (you and your customers).\nThe LINAR team and I work well together because we both detest overcomplication and aim to focus on simple and transparent processes that deliver results. In that vein, here are three things that you can do to ensure your marketing and sales processes/teams work harmoniously.\nClarity\nClarity is the foundation of creating the differentiation that we all desire. \nOne question you should have as clear as a Bahamian sea:\nWhat is your USP (Unique Selling Point)? Or put simply, what makes you different? Assume other law firms have good lawyers, decent processes and charge a similar fee, so what makes you different? Challenge yourselves to be honest with why your customers should (and do) choose you and bring that into your messaging and be single-minded about it. What comes out of that is your value proposition.\nSimplicity. Avoid jargon and complex language where possible. Use straightforward, plain English to communicate your messages. Your potential customers should be able to understand what you offer and how you can help them within seconds.\nVisual Clarity. If you are different from other law firms, than that should come to life in your visual identity – your logo, your colours, iconography etc – across your website, LinkedIn, emails, ads etc. Visual clarity means customers remember you. It’s that simple. But only if you are consistent….\nConsistency\nConsistency in simple terms builds recognition over time. Consistency builds trust. When you are consistent across all touchpoints, it reinforces your firm’s identity and helps potential customers remember you. So, how to maintain consistency?\nConsistent visual identity. Use the same logo, colour palette, and typography across all platforms—your website, social media, business cards, and all marketing collateral. This visual consistency helps create a cohesive brand image – and builds trust.\nConsistent tone of voice. Develop a brand voice and stick to it. Build a solid framework of 3 or 4 key principles that you want to be known for. Are you a human brand? Transparent? Trustworthy? Innovators? Good value? \nConsistent messaging. Whether it’s the content of your regular blog posts, the style of your email updates, or the wording on your website, a consistent message helps customers understand who you are and what you stand for. And please be concise….\nBe Concise\nIn an age of information overload, brevity is key. Concise communication ensures that your messaging is received and understood quickly. \nClear Calls to Action (CTAs). Every piece of content should have a clear purpose and a direct call to action. Whether it’s encouraging visitors to contact you for a consultation or download a legal playbook, make sure the next step is obvious.\nStreamlined Content. Across all industries the number one issue that I come across, and fix, is businesses want to tell everyone everything, right now. \nWe do this, this, and that, but don’t forget we also do this really well and this, and that….all of a sudden your customers can’t work out what you’re trying to sell and what you are really good at. You don’t need to say everything all at once.\nFocused Marketing Collateral. Be selective about the information you include in your marketing materials. Focus on the most important details that convey your value proposition and benefits. Leave out anything that doesn’t directly support your message.\nMost firms don’t have all these things nailed, but focussing on CLARITY, CONSISTENCY and being CONCISE can make all the difference.\nIf you get the above right, the quality of leads and the speed at which these leads become customers improves exponentially.\nBack to you, Lee… \n01/07/24 – the conference edition\nLast week, LINAR sponsored their first industry conference. And boy, was it hard work! From stand development, workshop preparation and the all important merchandise (stash) discussions, there’ a lot that goes into making an impact at these types of event.\nWhether sponsoring or just participating, there are some tried and tested techniques for maximising the ROI you can gain from your attendance. The value of a conference often lies in the connections you make and the knowledge you gain, so approach each opportunity with a strategic mindset.\nIn a lessons learned session post conference last week, the LINAR team (including our colleague Chat GPT) brainstormed their tips and tricks which form the basis of this week’s Three Things. Enjoy.\nPre-Conference Prep\nLike most things in life, a little planning goes a very long way. Setting yourself up for success pre conference is critical in maximising your time on the ground.\nSet Clear Objectives: Define your goals for the conference. Whether it's networking, learning about the latest industry trends, or meeting potential clients, having clear objectives will help you stay focused.\nResearch attendees and sessions: Review the attendee list and the conference agenda. Identify key people you want to meet and must-attend sessions. Use LinkedIn to connect with attendees in advance and set up meetings. If there are new targets you want to meet, look for existing contacts that are also attending the conference and may be able to provide a warm intro.\nPrepare Your Pitch: Craft a concise and compelling elevator pitch about your services or products. Be ready to explain who you are, what you do, and what makes your offerings unique in 30 seconds or less. Rehearse your pitch in front of the mirror and with colleagues in the days before the conference. \nMaximise Networking Opportunities\nYou have no doubt taken time out of an incredibly busy schedule to attend this conference so you can catch up with existing contacts and make new connections. DO NOT spend the entire conference either on your phone back to the office and/or speaking with colleagues from your business who you can speak do, all day every day! Get out there. Outside your comfort zone and network!\nEngage actively in sessions: Attend sessions relevant to your objectives, actively participate in Q&A sessions, and engage with speakers and fellow attendees. This is a great way to build connections and showcase your expertise. Always ask for a copy of the slides and use interesting comments other people make during sessions as an opportunity for a follow up/introduction: “I found your comment in the last session really interesting. Can we grab a coffee in the break to continue the conversation?”\nUse social media: Leverage conference hashtags on Twitter and LinkedIn to join the conversation and increase your visibility. Share insights, post updates, and tag people you meet to stay connected.\nHave contact details ready: in a digital age, business cards are increasingly rare, cumbersome and liable to be lost. LinkedIn provide a handy QR code feature designed for quick information exchange. You can also create your own digital business card using one of the many QR code generators and save it as the wallpaper on your phone during conferences.\nFollow-Up\nFollow up promptly: Send personalised follow-up emails to the contacts you made within 48 hours of the conference. Mention something specific from your conversation to jog their memory and reinforce the connection.\nOrganise your contacts: After the conference, go through the business cards and notes you collected. Input them into your CRM system and categorise them based on follow-up priority. Add them to marketing and newsletter distribution lists so they start receiving your frequent communications.\nShare your learnings: summarise the key insights and trends you observed at the conference and bang this up on LinkedIn as soon as possible after the conference has ended. Tag in all of the people you met and had conversations with. This will help you to position yourself as a thought leader and provide value to your network.\n\n \n08/07/24 - Rapid Response Initiatives\nThe Euros. The UK election. Glastonbury. Wimbledon. The US Elections. My upcoming holiday. Lewis Hamilton’s win yesterday. As this list would suggest, we’re not short of world events (possibly not my holiday) to talk about. Event triggers such as these and others (think landmark cases, world gatherings (e.g. Davos), impending regulations etc) provide a fantastic sales & marketing opportunity to get in front of your prospects and demonstrate your agility and capabilities to respond to the macro environment. In a fast-paced market, the ability to react quickly to event based triggers can set you apart from the competition.\nAt a place I used to work we termed these Rapid Response Initiatives (RRI). Three Things this week deconstructs what it takes to make an RRI successful. Enjoy.\nSpeed to Market\nIn a digital world of convenience and instant gratification, speed is crucial. The quicker you can get your campaign out, the better. Timing is everything; being the first to address a trending topic or event can capture the audience's attention more effectively. Speed to market can also provide a competitive advantage –get out in front of the competition to steal some of their market. Delays can mean missed opportunities. Consider the following to increase speed to market:\n•\tFoster a culture of agility: ensure your team is prepared to act quickly by fostering a culture of agility within your organisation. This means having streamlined approval processes, empowering team members to make decisions on the fly, and encouraging a mindset that embraces rapid iteration and improvement.\n•\tAnalysis paralysis: perfection is impossible. That’s according to a recent commencement speech  made by Roger Federer, one of the greatest tennis players of all time who only won 54% of the points he played. Striving for 100% can often lead to delays that allow competitors to get ahead. It’s better to launch a campaign that is 80% perfect and refine it on the go, rather than waiting for it to be flawless. This approach also provides a natural follow up reason to continue contacting your targets as information becomes clearer and more updates are available. The marketplace rewards those who are timely and relevant, not necessarily those who are perfect.\nAdd value not words\nSummarising information isn’t enough. It never has been. And, in a world of Chat GPT, the new kid on the block is MUCH better than you at this task. Your audience is looking for insights and unique perspectives that they can’t find elsewhere. They want to know what impact this event has on them, something they can take to their committees / bosses and say “our advisers [insert company name] are all over this”. Add value by providing analysis, actionable insights, or expert opinions. This not only positions your brand as a thought leader but also keeps your audience engaged and coming back for more.\nDistribution - use hooks and nets\nAn RRI calls for both precision and blunt force. You want to get your view out to as many of your Total Addressable Market (TAR) as possible whilst still very much tailoring your message and impact analysis to your core customers. Bear in mind the following when discussing your Go To Market (GTM) approach:\n•\tGo omni-channel: for speed to market, the two primary channels available are good old fashioned email and LinkedIn. These platforms will allow you to quickly contact your existing customers (email) and push your views to a wider target audience (LinkedIn). As the initiative unfolds, you should also be thinking about events (20 min flash webinars work well in the legal industry), impact analysis calls (driven straight from your CTAs) and advertising of your solution to the event trigger. Each channel offers unique opportunities to engage with different segments of your audience.\n•\tEnsure a Strong Call to Action (CTA): decide what you want the reader to do with the information the second after they have read and understood it. Whether it's driving traffic to your website, encouraging social media engagement, or prompting sign-ups for a webinar, a strong CTA guides your audience on what to do next. Make sure your CTA is prominently displayed and directly related to the content of your message, so your audience knows exactly how to engage further.\n \n15/07/24 – did it come home?\nSo close and yet so far. Another final, another night without silverware. Gareth and the lads did everything they could last night to bring the trophy home but it wasn’t to be. At LINAR, we’re all immensely proud of the England team’s efforts over the past month.\nThis week, we’re focusing on how to handle and bounce back from a crushing defeat. Whether it’s a lost case, a failed pitch, or a disappointing client meeting, setbacks are part of the journey. Here are three things to help you reflect, learn, and move forward stronger.\nAcknowledge the loss\nShit happens. It’s important to face the reality of a defeat head-on. Denying or downplaying it can hinder your recovery and growth. Take some time to process what happened and how it makes you feel. This is not a sign of weakness but a crucial step in moving forward.\n•\tReflect: Spend a few quiet moments acknowledging the defeat. Write down your thoughts and feelings. This exercise can help in mentally processing the setback.\n•\tShare: Discuss your experience with trusted colleagues or mentors. Sometimes, external perspectives can provide insights you might have missed and emotional support that can be invaluable.\nAnalyse the facts\nUnderstanding why you faced a setback is key to avoiding similar issues in the future. Conduct a thorough post-mortem of the situation, focusing on what went wrong and what could have been done differently.\n•\tSeek feedback: speak to colleagues and clients to understand how the outcome could have been different. Ask direct questions about the role you played and if a different approach could have been taken.   \n•\tIdentify mistakes: List out specific errors or misjudgements. Was there a gap in preparation? Did you miss a critical piece of information?\n•\tLearn and implement: Each mistake is a learning opportunity. Develop a plan to address these gaps. This might involve additional training, seeking advice, or adjusting your strategies.\nBounce back stronger \nNow that you’ve acknowledged the loss and analysed the reasons behind it, it’s time to bounce back with a solid plan. Setting clear, achievable goals can help you regain confidence and focus.\n•\tRemain positive: setbacks are a natural part of any professional journey. Stay positive, be persistent, and view each challenge as an opportunity to grow and improve.\n•\tSet SMART Goals: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound goals can guide your recovery. For instance, if you lost a pitch due to lack of preparation, recognize this and factor in more time for the next opportunity.\n•\tTeam debrief: Hold a debriefing session with your team. Open communication about what went wrong and how to improve can foster a collaborative and resilient work environment.\n \n22/05/24 - Nothing like a crisis…\nFriday’s global IT outage demonstrated our increasing dependence and reliability on digital systems and communication methods to run business and communications with our clients.\nWhilst we do not believe the CrowdStrike incident was malicious, the proliferation of sophisticated denial of service attacks, phishing emails and basic human error raises the probability that these types of events are on the increase and are costing organisations a LOT of money.\nIn a sales context, how you handle a crisis can make or break your firm's reputation. This week, we delve into three essential strategies for managing and communicating during a crisis. Enjoy.\nPrepare to fail...\nPreparation is everything. In the heat of a crisis, having a well thought out plan can be your saving grace. Here’s what to consider:\n•\tIdentify potential risks: use recent events to brainstorm possible crises that could impact your firm. This could range from data breaches to negative publicity.\n•\tEstablish a crisis team: Designate a team responsible for crisis management, including members from PR, legal, IT and senior leadership. Make sure there is a hierarchy of command so that decisions can be made quickly. \n•\tCreate a communication protocol: Develop a step by step guide on how to communicate during a crisis. This should include who speaks, what is communicated, and through which channels. Goes without saying but, if the crisis relates to your IT systems and communications infrastructure, email and/or corporate phones might not be an option…\nReflect on your current preparedness. Do you have a crisis team in place? Are you aware of the potential risks to your firm? If not, it’s time to start building your crisis communication plan.\nClient comms - KISS\nWhen the sh^t hits the fan, clear and transparent communication with clients (and your staff) are crucial. Here’s how to ensure your messaging is effective:\n•\tBe transparent: Honesty is key. Acknowledge the issue, provide clear facts, and avoid speculation. Clients appreciate transparency, which builds trust – THE most effective sales tool.\n•\tDon’t leave them hanging: Keep clients informed with regular updates. Even if there’s no new information, letting them know you’re actively managing the situation is reassuring. Consider setting an update timetable (e.g. comms every 12 hours) so that clients get used to the communication pattern.\n•\tTailor your message: Different clients may need different information. Tailor your communication to address specific concerns and impacts relevant to each client. Do your key/platinum clients need a different type of response to others? Do you need to segment or tier your client base?\nConsider the last time your firm faced a crisis. How well did you communicate with your clients? Were they kept informed and reassured? If not, think about how you can improve transparency and timeliness in future communications.\nThe First 24 Hours\nIn crisis management, timing is everything. The first 24 hours are crucial in determining how the situation will unfold. Here’s how to make the most of this critical window:\n•\tImmediate assessment: As soon as a crisis hits, mobilise your crisis team immediately and assess the situation promptly. Gather all the facts and understand the scope and potential impact. Quick assessment allows for a faster and more informed response.\n•\tDon’t let perfect be the enemy of good: Delay in response can exacerbate the crisis. Issue an initial statement within the first few hours acknowledging the situation. Even if all details are not yet available, letting clients and stakeholders know that you are aware and actively addressing the issue is vital. \n•\tMonitor and adapt: Use the first 24 hours to not only respond but also to monitor the situation. Social media, news outlets, and client feedback will provide real-time information that can guide your next steps. Be prepared to adapt your strategy as new information becomes available.\nConsider a crisis you’ve heard about recently. How did the affected firm handle the first 24 hours? What could they have done better? Use these reflections to enhance your own crisis management strategies and ensure your firm is prepared to act swiftly and effectively when needed.\n \n29/07/24 – Olympic edition\nAs the Olympics begin, one can only marvel at the dedication and expertise of the athletes, particularly the solo track and field disciplines, where people have given so much of their lives to so specific an activity.\nExpertise at work can be similarly hard-earned - the \"10,000 hours\" concept suggesting that mastery only comes after many years of effort. However, in today's world, Generative AI (GenAI) can make anyone appear highly knowledgeable on any subject—a powerful but risky tool if used without proper understanding. Here are three essential tips for using AI responsibly, especially when venturing outside your comfort zone.\n1. Know your limits\nJust as athletes train to excel in specific events, it's crucial to recognise your limitations when using AI. Avoid relying on AI for tasks you are entirely unfamiliar with. Use AI to enhance your understanding, not replace it. If you're learning, use AI to complement your existing knowledge, ensuring you grasp the basics first.\n2. Verify Sources and Methodology\nAI can be incredibly persuasive, but it's vital to check the validity of the information it provides. Most modern LLMs now include sources or explanations of their reasoning process. Always review these details to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with data or producing content in areas where you're not an expert.\n3. Cross-Check with Multiple Sources\nTo avoid relying on potentially flawed AI output, use multiple sources for validation. This can include running the same query through different LLMs or revisiting the conversation with a critical eye. Some advanced AI setups perform this verification automatically, but you can easily set it up manually as well.\nAs access to knowledge becomes increasingly democratised, the real skill lies in how we wield this power. In a world where AI can make us all seem like experts, the differentiator will be our ability to use these tools wisely, verifying and understanding the information they provide. Just like the Olympic athletes, dedication to mastering our tools and knowledge will set us apart.\nStay tuned for more insights and tips on leveraging AI in your work over the coming weeks. For more detailed exploration and hands-on experience, consider joining our upcoming workshops where we delve into these topics and more. Get in touch for more details.\n \n19/08/24 – what we’re doing with Gen AI\nAfter a fantastic couple of weeks away recharging the batteries, we’re back with a vengeance and brimming with a bucketload of ideas about how we can help clients in the run up to Christmas (128 days – just saying). \nThis week we’re back on the topic of Gen AI. It has dominated the LINAR summer in a variety of areas. One consistent thread we’re hearing from clients is that they are all struggling to find the jumping off point for using Gen AI within their day to day activities. As a result, quite a few are languishing in the trough of disillusionment and wondering how to start climbing the slope of enlightenment. If you’re struggling with this terminology, watch the guys at Gartner give a brief intro to their hype cycle.\nThis week’s Three Things describes the LINAR Gen AI journey to date and the fun we’re having along the way. Enjoy.\nLearn by doing\nThere are a plethora of companies out there at the moment with some really smart people harnessing the power of Gen AI to solve everyday business problems. The great thing is that most of these companies have free trials where you can test their products. We’ve been having some fun recently with the following:\n•\tFireflies.ai: an AI notetaker, fireflies.ai joins every online LINAR meeting and captures an accurate record of what’s been said, agreed and the follow up actions. Using the keyword functionality, we’re starting to train fireflies.ai to pick up on certain terms and phrases so that the action lists produced are more accurate and require less editing. The sentiment analysis can also show trends for our sales calls and predict outcomes based on factors including the amount of time we’ve spent talking rather than listening. \n•\tSuperwhisper: hands down, in our view, the best gen AI dictation device on the market currently. We really like the ability to choose what you’re doing (email, note, general etc) and get different outputs based on the model you choose. In fact, the base for today’s Three Things was dictated as I was walking around Richmond Green yesterday lunchtime with the dog!\n•\tKore.ai: allows low code/no code development of chatbots (AI assistants) based on sources of data defined by you. One thing we’re playing with is an AI assistant (chatbot) to help with new quotes/pitches. We’ve loaded in anonymised versions of all previous quotes and then ask the chatbot to generate a new quote based on a structured set of questions and historical data.\nListen to your clients\nNobody we’ve spoken to has cracked Gen AI and/or implemented it successfully across all parts of their business. Firms around the city are at wildly different ends of a spectrum that begins with fear and rejection and continues through to cautious adoption. \nWhat has become clear during our client conversations is that most firms recognise that Gen AI is not another fad. The technology is here to stay and its use will start to permeate the roles we all perform, whether we like it or not.\nFrom a LINAR perspective, we’re building a bank of interesting use cases based on the conversations we’re having with clients and also asking ourselves the simple question, “How could Gen AI help with this?”, in every job we do. We’ll share this list with you in a later edition of Three Things.\nBe transparent \nWe’ve been thinking A LOT about the future and how Gen AI will shape the work LINAR will be doing. Our GenAI lead, Sam Stamp, has developed a simple categorisation to show transparently where we’re using Gen AI outputs. Going forward, all our client facing work will be assigned a category:\n•\tAH (All Human): good old fashioned human grunt. Not a chatbot or LLM in sight.\n•\tPA (Part AI): we’ve used a commercial Gen AI platform (e.g. Chat GPT, Gemini etc) to help us with a piece of work. A lot of the time, this takes the form of what Sam calls a “blank page problem”. You have an idea in your head of what you want to do but are struggling to start putting it down into words. Chat GPT is BRILLIANT at providing a first draft. Equally, we could have prompted a platform to conduct some competitor research, define a Total Addressable Market (TAR) or help us design a social media plan. We think there are a LOT of exciting possibilities in this category.\n•\tAA (All AI):  an output totally generated by Gen AI with no human correction. Obviously, like most other sensible businesses, we are aware of the risks associated with pushing content out without a human pair of eyes so have nothing in this bucket, yet. However, with the advancement of agentic AI (see short 7 min article here), we’re very conscious that areas like marketing and sales are ripe for a well trained Gen AI platform to start interacting with targets independently of the human LINAR team. For example, platforms like La Growth Machine are already seeing success in this area.  \nIn case you were wondering, we’ve categorised this week’s Three Things as PA (Part AI) because I used Superwhisper to create my draft!\n \n\n\n \n27/08/24 – The Golden Goose\nSales is hard. Finding new prospects, identifying their key pain points, building sufficient trust in you and the products and/or services you’re selling and ultimately convincing them to part with their money, is an arduous and unforgiving process that goes wrong more times than it goes right.  \nWhat if there was a way to load the dice in your favour? Well, there is – sell to your existing customers! Statistically, Harvard Business Review estimate it costs (time & effort) five to 25 times more to acquire a new customer than it does to retain (or sell) to an existing one. According to Bain, increasing retention by 5% can increase profits by up to 95%.\nThis week’s Three Things is all about ensuring that you look after those Golden Geese and how exceptional service can be your best sales tool and the key to customer retention. Enjoy!\nDo a good job, constantly\nIn professional services, NOTHING sells better than a consistently high quality of service. In our experience, the below phrase goes a long way and puts you in a small minority of practitioners.  \nDWYSYGTDWYSYGTDI\nDo What You Say You’re Going To Do, When You Say You’re Going To Do It!\nDoing a good job, repeatedly, builds the reliability component of David Maister’s Trust Equation. When discussing additional sales or sales within a new area, you can then use (or more accurately borrow) this trust that has been built to provide additional credibility (another facet of the Trust Equation) to strengthen your sales proposition.\nMake them feel special\nEveryone likes feeling special and important. Customers are no different. Work hard to make your customers feel like they are your only customer. Here’s three ways we’ve found works for us:\n•\tAnticipate what the need before they know they need it \nGreat service isn’t just about responding to what a customer asks for – it’s about predicting what they’ll need next. Whether it’s a heads-up on upcoming regulatory changes or an offer to streamline a process before it becomes a headache, anticipating needs shows clients you’re always thinking ahead on their behalf. \n•\tThe personal touch: if there’s a market event, press story, political announcement etc that affects your customer, ring them to see what impact(s) it’s had. Failing that, send them a note to alert them to the topic. At the very least, it will signpost you are thinking about them.\n•\tRegular non-work contact: make it a habit to check in on your key customers (current and lapsed) at least monthly. Phone calls are always better than email as they are generally ignored less. Don’t seek to sell on these calls – simply asking how people are and what they are up to invariably leads to follow up opportunities.\nCreate a continuous feedback loop\nCustomer feedback is one of the greatest gifts for a services based industry. BUT, only if you act on the feedback given. Customers remember when their feedback results in tangible improvements. Next time a key customer gives you input – good or bad – don’t just nod and file it away. Show them you’re listening by making changes where necessary and letting them know about it. A quick email to say, “We’ve implemented your suggestion,” can reinforce that you’re committed to providing top-notch service. It’s the kind of proactive communication that keeps customers coming back.\nWe’ve also found that longstanding customers who you’ve worked with for a while will be more prone to providing honest feedback on the services you provide and can also be used to test out new products and ideas.\n \n02/09/24 – Sales CPR\nWe regularly run sales training sessions for lawyer teams and M&BD teams. One of the first questions we ask is “What one word comes to mind when we say the word sales?”\nAnswers similar to the above are not uncommon. Sales continues to have a VERY bad rap in professional services as a dirty and grubby activity that other people engage in.\nThis week we’re going to look at sales through the behaviours we believe are critical to enabling a better sales culture within your firm. We call it Sales CPR ©. Enjoy.\nConfidence\nDone well, someone who is confident with be engaging, enthusiastic, curious and provide and energy to the conversation that is infectious. The evil twin of confidence, arrogance, manifests itself in talking too much, assuming you know everything and generally dominating a conversation (sound familiar?). In a sales context, think about confidence in the following ways:\n•\tBe vulnerable: you don’t need to know all the answers. It’s OK to say “I don’t know”. Use this to create an opportunity for follow up or to introduce a colleague. Have the self confidence to ask the questions everyone else is thinking but most are too afraid to ask for looking dumb. \n•\tEnthusiasm goes a long way: to build trust and convince your buyer to invest in your product/service, they need to believe that you believe your offering can help them solve a problem. A lackluster discussion with you just going through the motions and reading from a script is not going to cut it. Make sure that whatever is going on in your world, before every sales meeting/call, you take 30 seconds to get into a mindset that is brimming with energy and opportunities. It’s infectious.  \n•\tKnow enough to be dangerous: whilst you don’t need to know everything (see above), knowing something is good. Become a student of your product / service. Even better, learn (at a high level) the adjacent services you can offer and make introductions. You will only become dangerous if the arrogant evil twin, arrogance, makes an appearance and you overstate your own capabilities. At this point it’s best to introduce a colleague.\nPerseverance\nBe honest with yourself. Once you’ve engaged with a prospect, sent across some information and/or a proposal, how many times do you follow up with them? The answer is nowhere near enough. Commonly, attendees at our training sessions (both lawyers and M&BD) feel uncomfortable or awkward following up more than twice. Regular excuses include:\n“I don’t want to bother them.” ”They’ve got our proposal, they’ll respond when they’re ready.” “I don’t want to seem pushy.” “What if they say no?”\nThe reality is that you are very likely not to be the most important person in your prospect’s day. They may well be responding to the other 100+ emails they have received or navigating their own internal politics to get you a decision. Or, because they are human, they may have simply forgotten about you. \nGet over yourself and have the grit to systematically follow up every interested lead or opportunity. In your follow ups, make sure to add value at every stage. In a world of AI and an increasing number of auto generated follow ups, you have to differentiate yourself. At the engagement & opportunity stage of the sales lifecycle, each follow up should contain additional information on your product/service to support your target with their buying decision. For example, proactively offer up a referee from a similar client who has previously purchased. When you get to the negotiation stage, consider offers to walk through your proposal, answer questions the prospect may have or help with their internal signoff process.\nThe stats below show what is takes to succeed. Push yourself to get uncomfortable and be better than average.\n[insert stats]\nResilience\nDepending on which stats you believe, somewhere between 8 & 9 / 10 opportunities will result in a “no”. They are pretty overwhelming odds! Given that level of rejection, why would anyone engage in the sales process?\nPut simply, because you cannot afford not to. Like it or not, sales is an integral part of being successful within professional services. In order to survive, you need to build up the thickness of your skin to take the inevitable knockbacks. When facing a disappointing result, consider the following: \n•\tIt’s not personal: prospects will evaluate your product / service on a large variety of factors (need, capability, prior experience, team, price etc). Too many people we talk to take an adverse decision very personally. This behaviour taints future opportunities for fear of additional rejection. Again, get over yourself and realise the decision was highly unlikely to be about you. Put on your big person pants and engage in… \n•\tThe gift of feedback: when you get the wrong answer on an opportunity you’ve spent a lot of time on and need to win, you’re likely (if you’re anything like us) to want to blame the prospect, issue obscenities to the computer screen and generally boil over into a rage. That’s OK. It shows you care. Once the tantrum is over, however, make sure you ask your prospect for feedback on why they didn’t choose you. At a minimum, this information should be captured for win/loss purposes. It also may uncover an aspect of your pitch/proposal that can be refined for future opportunities.\n \n09/09/24 – It’s a marathon…\nYesterday, alongside nearly 50,000 other folk, I completed the Great North Run. 13.1miles / 21km running around Newcastle in a cacophony of noise and cheering, all culminating in the run down into South Shields and that finishers (survivors) medal. It’s a fantastic event, the largest participation half marathon in the world, with runners of every size, shape and age participating, all for their own reasons.\nThose two hours gave me time to think. Distance running is a lot like sales. Here’s how. \nThis week’s Three Things is dedicated to everyone yesterday who had the courage to get onto that start line. Enjoy.\nPut a plan together\nYou don’t just turn up and run a half marathon*. Once you’ve made the decision to enter a race, you devise a training plan to incrementally build up your stamina, speed, distance to get you to that start line.\nSales is no different. Prior to a product or service launch there are hard yards to do in identifying customer problems, crafting sales messages, defining buyer personas, creating your target market. You need to build sales decks, FAQ documents, brainstorm potential objections and how to answer. The list goes on. As with running though, the more you put in before the start, the better the start will be. \nThere’s no substitute for getting the miles in\nTo prepare for a race you will incrementally build up the distances you run over a series of weeks (or months if you’re better prepared than me). This helps your legs to adjust to the increased distance and impact, building the muscle memory so that there are no surprises when you get to the start line. You’ll use your training runs to test out different running paces, equipment, nutrition gels etc to decide on the optimal mix for your race.\nBuilding your sales muscle memory is no different. Start small. Practice your pitch on smaller customers and/or targets you don’t yet know and have a lower starting probability of converting. Test and refine your proposition, tweaking and learning as you go. Try different techniques and sales messages – bin those that don’t work or feel right. By the time you get to the start line (launch), you'll have a razor sharp sales patter that covers all bases.\nRun your own race \nWhen the gun sounds on race day that’s it. It’s just you against the distance. All the training and preparation are done – now it’s just one foot in front of the other, over and over again until the finish. Make sure you run your own race. Don’t be tempted to speed up in the early stages because you feel good – it will come back to bite you later on!\nSales is a long distance sport. In professional services, the distances are getting longer. More sophisticated buying processes, increased stakeholders in a buying decision and the rise and rise of procurement teams are elongating the sales cycle. At times, it will feel like there is no end to the process and a sale is impossible. At these times, fall back on your training and the preparation you’ve done. Stick to what you know and all the miles you’ve put in. Just put one foot in front of the other and keep going. Never give up.\nFinal thought\nAnd when the race is done and the sale is made, allow yourself a brief moment of congratulations at a job well done. Then sign up for the next race…. 😉.\n*unless you’re my mate Nimms, but he’s a freak of nature.\n \n23/09/24 – Sh^t happens\nLet’s face it, we all make mistakes. Whether business or personal, there are times when we make the wrong call and get something wrong. Rarely, in the world of sales and business development are mistakes final or the type which cannot be rectified. \nHowever, how we handle our missteps can make or break our success. This week, we focus on three simple yet essential actions when you make a mistake—own it, fix it, and learn from it. Enjoy.\nOwn it\nWhether it’s a missed deadline, wrong information, or a client misunderstanding, be upfront. Trying to brush a mistake under the carpet will only makes things worse. FACT. In the fast-paced world of sales and marketing, the best approach is to face a situation head-on. A quick and honest admission shows integrity and builds trust, which is crucial in maintaining strong client relationships. Avoid starting a blame game with other teams and trying to pass the responsibility for the mistake onto others.\nOnce the mistake has been identified, act quickly. Call your customer (this is not a time to hide behind emails), explain what has happened and what you plan to do to resolve the situation.\nFix it\nAfter owning up, it’s time to put things right. Offer a clear plan for resolution and act swiftly. Customers appreciate solutions, not excuses. Ramp up the comms - make sure to check in with the customer at regular intervals, ensuring that they are comfortable with your resolutions approach and the progress being made. The quicker and more effectively you can resolve an issue, the more confidence the customer will have in your ability to handle future challenges.\nLearn from it  \nOnce the situation has been resolved to the customers satisfaction, take a moment to reflect. What went wrong, and why? Was it a process issue, or a lapse in communication? Make a note of the mistake and the solution for future reference. Share it with your team to prevent similar mistakes in the future. Every slip-up is a learning opportunity if you use it wisely.\nMistakes are inevitable but how we handle them is what counts. Be honest, be proactive, and above all, make sure you learn from the experience!\n \n30/09/24 - BD ≠ networking drinks\nIf Family Fortunes (for those born post 2000 – explanation here) surveyed 100 professional services practitioners on what activities are involved in Business Development (BD), then we’re pretty sure that networking drinks would come in as one of the top answers.\nWe think that’s a shame. It’s obviously not a wrong answer. But why focus on the one activity most people in the professions fear more than the dentist when there’s a whole panacea of other options available to you.\nThis week, we’re getting personal. Done well, BD is an extension of your character. You have to mould your BD activities to reflect you as a person. Here’s three tips to get you going. Enjoy. \nFind your splendid splinter\nWhether you are an accountant, lawyer, BD professional or engineer, becoming the very best you can at something is a brilliant way to get you noticed by customers and peers alike.\nFor those reading this week at the more junior end of their careers, pile into Gen AI, learn everything you can and become the go to expert within your firm to solve AI related questions.\nFor those more advanced in their career journey, there’s still hope! Get to grips with a new market dynamic, international regulation, updated code of conduct, revised accounting rules etc. \nOnce you have found your splendid splinter, make sure EVERYONE else knows about it. Use your BD techniques and activities (see below) to inform customers and peers that you are the go to person for advice on your topic of choice. \nBD your way\nThe range of BD activities available means that there is something for everyone. FACT. To say you’re not good at BD means you’re either very narrow in your view of the BD tools out there or you’re simply not trying hard enough.\nThe reality is that whatever BD activity you choose, it has to be authentic and suit your own style and personality. So, if you don’t like networking functions and having to make conversation with complete strangers, DON’T DO IT!\nOur advice is simple:\n•\tChoose 3-4 business development activities from the list that you enjoy (or, at the very least, don’t hate). Ensure that at least one activity is outside of your comfort zone. \n•\tSet yourself a challenge to conduct each activity at least  once per month.\n•\tMaintain a record of which activities:\n•\t You enjoy most\n•\tGenerate greatest Return On Investment (ROI)\nAnd repeat. And repeat. And repeat. And repeat. And repeat. And repeat. And repeat.\nAn ex-colleague of ours once compared the memory of most General Counsel’s to that of a goldfish. What he meant by that was that they will likely use the person they last saw or received something from when instructing outside counsel.\nOnce you have your stable of go to BD activities, be rigorously efficient in performing them consistently. Do not get disheartened if your updates receive no replies and your social posts are not given a thumbs up. Persevere safe in the knowledge that the process works. Remain front of mind and you will win work.\nBusiness development activities \nWe've given it a go to compile as many BD activities as we can. Have we missed any? Let us know.\nClient Relationship Management\n•\tRegular client check-ins\n•\tClient entertainment\n•\tClient feedback surveys\n•\tClient alerts & updates\n•\tClient training\nNetworking and relationship building\n•\tIndustry conferences\n•\tProfessional associations\n•\tReferrals & introductions\nContent marketing & thought leadership\n•\tWriting articles\n•\tBlogging\n•\tCase studies\n•\tNewsletters\n•\tWhite Papers & reports\nSocial media\n•\tLinkedIn articles\n•\tEngage with others’ posts\n•\tPodcast guesting\n•\tWebinars\nClient acquisition & pitching\n•\tPitch presentations\n•\tProposals and RFPs\n•\tCross-selling services\n•\tClient “cold” outreach\nInternal firm initiatives\n•\tCollaboration with other departments\nPersonal Brand Development\n•\tSpeaking engagements\n•\tAwards & recognitions\n•\tMedia contributions\n \n07/10/24 – Dead cats\n‘‘Three-year-olds, on average, ask their parents about 100 questions a day, every day! However, by the time they are ten to 11 years of age they’ve pretty much stopped asking. Of even greater concern is that by the age of 25, only two percent can think outside the box. Curiosity seldom survives childhood.” Futurelearn.com\nCuriosity might have killed the cat, but it’s the lifeblood of an effective salesforce. As the quote above suggests, over time, many of us lose the natural curiosity we had as children, and in the world of professional services, that can be a real blocker to success. People buy emotionally first and then back that purchase up with logic. Here’s the truth: if you aren’t genuinely curious about your customers and their businesses, you’ll miss out on the real opportunities to help them. \nIn Three Things this week, we explore ways to rekindle your curiosity and supercharge your sales game. Enjoy.\nAsk questions you don’t know the answer to\nAs we get older we tend to limit the questions we ask to “safe” questions – those which we already know the answer to. This fear of the unknown prevents us from exploring new opportunities and finding out new things about our customers.\nInstead of sticking to the questions you already know the answers to, challenge yourself to ask something different. For example:\n•\t\"What are you trying to achieve over the next 12 months?\"\n•\t\"What’s the biggest challenge your business is currently facing?\"\n•\t“What’s most important to you about this deal, purchase, transaction?”\nThese questions can unlock deeper insights and uncover opportunities that a typical surface-level conversation wouldn’t reveal.\nEngage with enthusiasm\nYour customers can tell when you’re truly interested in what they’re saying, and when you’re just going through the motions. Show a genuine passion for their problems and projects. Enthusiasm is contagious—when your customer sees you’re invested in their success, they’re more likely to trust you as a partner who’s ready to help solve their challenges.\nA lot of this enthusiasm comes through in a meeting environment not by what you say but in the tone of your voice and the body language you use. A monotone summary of your sales pitch where you look at your notes and avoid eye contact is unlikely to inspire your customer into action. However, a positive and energetic presence in the room (or on the screen) can lift the person you are talking to.\nAt LINAR, that’s why we don’t do sales calls on a Friday afternoon as your prospect is likely to have had a tough week, is looking to get their stuff sorted ahead of the weekend. Similarly, if you’re not in the right frame of mind for a sales call, better to reschedule rather than provide a lacklustre performance. \nGet comfortable being uncomfortable \nIn our experience, one of the most difficult phrases to master in the world of professional services is:\n“I don’t know”\nThree (there’s always three 😉) pretty small and innocuous words that strike fear into lawyers, accounts and engineers alike. Why? Because their training has likely instilled in them a feeling that they need to have all the answers. \nSales is different. In our experience, the very best sales conversations come from not knowing. Embrace the unknown, and don’t be afraid to say, “That’s interesting! Can you tell me more about that?” By being open to learning, you’ll uncover far more potential business opportunities than if you stick to the script.\nCuriosity is also as important internally as it is externally. Spend time with your colleagues within your business and get to know what they do. Then, when you’re asked by a customer for a recommendation on a service that isn’t in your wheelhouse, you’ll feel much more comfortable introducing your colleagues as a subject matter expert in their area.\nCuriosity doesn’t just lead to better conversations—it leads to better outcomes. Get curious today and watch how it transforms your customer relationships.\n \n14/10/24 – Nail your network\nRecently, we were looking for a builder to help us with the construction of LINAR HQ. So we asked around the various local Whats App chats (kids school parents, rugby club etc) and received no less than eight recommendations for quality builders in the area.\nWhy are we telling you this? Because networks work! Building relationships and referral networks are a key tool in the successful sales arsenal. They take time (sometimes decades) to develop and require regular nurturing but will prove invaluable at different moments during your career.\nDon't take our word for it. Heidi Gardner, a Harvard professor specialising in law firms, has written an entire book on Smart Collaboration. Well worth a read if you haven't already. \n[insert image]\nThe diagram above provides a compelling argument for why time and effort should be given to development of your own network. Despite being equal in almost all other respects, the practitioner with the enhanced network (both internal and external) generated 4x the revenue of their colleague!\nThree Things this week looks at your current networks and how to get the most out of them. Enjoy.    \nCustomers\nDoing a good job for your existing customers is about the best BD tactic going. Nail this and you will create a network of individuals who, when asked for a referral, will espouse your skills as first rate! Customer testimonials are also a great way to capture the praise of your services into something that can be used across your future marketing materials. \nIn professional services, however, we tend to only focus on our current customers. Periodically, run through and reconnect with customers you’ve worked with in the previous 12 months. A quick catch up or call could uncover an opportunity for support and/or another intro to a potential target.\nInternal & external referrers\nYour internal network is as, if not more, important than your external network. Why? It is highly likely that your colleagues are engaging with some of your target customers on a day to day basis. As and when a situation arise that requires your skillset, you need your colleagues to recommend you and transfer the trust that the customer has in them onto you. They will not be able to do this if they don’t know you / what you do! Take every opportunity to connect with colleagues internally:\n•\tPresent / talk at their team meetings\n•\tUse your internal comms function to profile your skillset\n•\tBe prepared to give your time/some advice/an opinion before you start to take.\nExternally, the message is the same. As you build your network you will come across businesses and individuals who are complementary and complementary to your own. Share with them your capabilities and updates / insights on your world so they can be informed and look good in front of their clients. This reciprocity will pay dividends down the tracks.\nDigital networking\nIn the corporate world, we cannot escape LinkedIn. Nor should we. It’s a fantastic platform for finding and nurturing connections with individuals or organsiations that might like what you have to sell. Building communities of contacts with shared interests and sharing information, updates and creating debates on topics of interest are great ways to broaden your network.\nThis platform is also a great way to keep track of people you have known in a previous life. Whether it’s former customers, old school friends, uni drinking buddies or law conversion alumni, a periodic check in to see how these people are getting on (and where they’ve ended up) is a good use of your time.\n\n \n21/10/24 – The Right Tone\nWe were recently posed a question we've heard a few times: “Should we say ‘please’ to Chat GPT??” It's always an interesting one because, firstly, politeness matters—it’s a basic human connection, even with machines, there's no harm! But more importantly, it got us thinking about the role of tone in all our interactions, especially in customer meetings.\nFirstly, it is important to be aware that, as a white man, I recognise that my natural tone often mirrors the expectations of my clients. It is, for many systemic reasons, seen as the 'default. But what might seem ‘neutral’ to me may be received differently by others. It’s a checkable privilege to speak from a position that aligns with mainstream business communication, and we must be conscious that this isn’t universal.\nThis week's Three Things uncovers the importance of tone in sales and how to adapt your tone to maximise input. Enjoy.\n1. Listen for emotional cues\nTone goes beyond the words spoken. Listen for the energy behind the words—are they excited, hesitant, or frustrated? Emotional undercurrents provide clues on how engaged or comfortable someone feels. If a customer's tone shifts unexpectedly during the course of a meeting, it could be a signal to pause and check in, allowing you to adjust your approach before the conversation loses its momentum. This is all part of 'active listening', a key part of any salesperson's toolkit.\n2. Read the body language\nTone isn’t just verbal; it’s physical. Body language is an underrated aspect of tone that can fill in the gaps between what’s said and what’s truly felt. This is clearly harder (but not impossible) on video calls, which have become the standard in many client interactions. Use of the hands and positioning of your camera can all help your presence on screen. \nThat said, we still believe to build long lasting rleationships you should always push for in-person meetings when possible. Relationships develop faster after at least one in-person chat, where you can read non-verbal cues much more clearly. At the very least, get people to turn on their cameras - it's only polite!\n3.  Mirror and adjust\nOne of the simplest, yet most effective tools is mirroring. By subtly matching a customer’s tone—whether formal or casual—you show you’re in tune with their style. But be careful: it’s not about mimicry, but about responding in a way that feels natural and adaptive. This builds rapport, and in situations where you’re not from the same background as your customer, it shows an awareness of their communication style, making the interaction more inclusive.\nAnd finally...\nTone isn’t just important for external customers; it’s just as crucial when dealing with internal stakeholders. Having worked extensively with Partners in law firms, I’ve seen firsthand that different Partners have different expectations around communication style. Understanding and adjusting your tone for internal customers is key to maintaining those relationships effectively.\n\n\n \n28/10/24 – Pain management \nDirectories season is well and truly upon us. In the last month, rankings have been released by both Chambers and Legal 500. LinkedIn has been awash with more plaques, badges and humble brags than an over enthusiastic girl guide. \nAt LINAR, directories are an enigma. We’ve spoken with over 50 stakeholders involved in the submissions process, ranging from the BD foot soldiers tasked with developing them, the partners who are thirsty for the rankings they provide and the outsourcers who seek to commercialise their creation. NO ONE has a good word to say about them. Not a single person. And yet, the 30+ law firms we’ve spoken to will not (or are not allowed) to contemplate giving them up?\nWhy? Ego mostly. The Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) on a ranking or a client quote means that they will again embark on an opaque and thankless process over the next few months which takes significant time, effort and resources across most firms for attainment of the holy grail – a BAND 1 ranking.\nWhy are we bothered at LINAR? Because every minute you spend on directories, you are foregoing the opportunity to do proper BD. And because we think we can help.\nOver the past three months, the LINAR team have developed Directorease, a technology enabled service designed to take the pain out of the directory submissions process. Here’s our view on the three main challenges with submission development and how Directorease will help you get the time back to concentrate on proper BD. \nEnjoy. \nProblem 1: Existing information\nPitch docs. Cap stats. Previous submissions. Website bios. Press releases. Other people’s press releases. You will rarely start from scratch with a submission document as there is plenty of information available that you’ve amassed over the previous 12 months. \nProblem is, it’s everywhere! If you’re anything like the stakeholders we spoke to, significant time, effort and frustration is expended trying to track down documentation that exists but you can’t quite put your finger on.\nDirectorease helps by sourcing, analysing and processing multiple information stores to extract relevant information and categorise for easy population of your submission template.\nProblem 2: New information  \nA lot of the detailed matter descriptions required for submissions reside with senior lawyers heads and are yet to be committed to paper. Our research with key stakeholders suggests that extraction requires lengthy info gathering meetings/interviews and repetitive follow ups to fill critical missing variables required by the directories houses.\nDirectorease solves this problem by:\n1.\tDeveloping tailored meeting scripts which prompt only for missing information required to complete the submission.\n2.\tCombining advanced transcription with smart prompting to identify submission gaps in near real time, ensuring that maximum ROI is generated for a single submissions meeting. \n3.\tAdding the content rich transcript to other data sources to enable the creation of a high quality submission document.\nProblem 3: reusing information \nPhew! Once the submission is done, it’s filed away (sometimes), ready to be used again in nine months time as the basis for next year’s submission. \nWhat a waste. You’ve worked hard to craft a submission that is rich in valuable content and matter descriptions that clearly articulate the value to other clients. Not only that, it’s likely that your key bios have been updated and your practice group descriptions have been refreshed. Why leave that hard work buried in a (virtual) drawer?\nPost submission, Directorease will synthesise your information and present it in a fromat that can be easily ingested to your website, experience databases, CRM and/or just about any other platform you’d like. And we’re not just talking here about a single submission. We’re talking about all submissions. Simple, effective processes that ensure you receive maximum value from the directories process across all of your BD and marketing channels.  \n\n \n04/11/24 - The BD jigsaw\nAt LINAR we get up early. Collectively, the team has a bunch of young children and so there are regularly calls at 0630 – 0700 before the school run begins and/or the work calls with customers start.\nA couple of weeks ago, I was listening to BBC Radio 2 and the Pause for thought segment. The Irish priest started to tell a story about life being similar to a jigsaw puzzle. A lot of what he said resonated and, as I thought some more about what the priest had said, I found there was a large similarity between jigsaws and BD.\nSo, thanks to Brian D’Arcy, this week’s Three Things focuses on the sales and BD lessons we can learn from jigsaw puzzles. Enjoy.\nSee the bigger picture\n“I have two kinds of problems: the urgent and the important. The urgent are not important, and the important are never urgent.” — Dwight D. Eisenhower\nIn professional services BD & marketing, everything always appears urgent. Whether it’s a pitch, webinar, social post or event, the timescales are always too short and we seem to move from one thing to another at breakneck pace. \nGet into a regular habit of taking 10-15 minutes every week to look at the bigger picture. Is everything you’re being asked to do really that valuable? What should you prioritise and push back on? How do the activities and tasks you’re working on support the achievement of the firm / sector / practice group / department / team objectives? \nStruggling to sort out what’s important? You could do a lot worse than to use the classic four box model below to organise your week. \n[IMAGE]\nhttps://slab.com/blog/eisenhower-matrix/ \nIf the piece don’t fit… \nWe’ve all been in BD & sales situations akin to pushing sh^t uphill. Despite logic, data and plain common sense arguments, your key stakeholder (lawyer, accountant, engineer) has strong views on the way to proceed that frankly are a work of pure fiction.\nRemain calm. Reassess your counter arguments but do not give up. Is there an alternate way to convince your stakeholder? Might there be a path where everyone comes out on top? \nStill no luck? It happens. At this point, you have to make a decision. Is the point you’re trying to get across important enough to derail the entire project? If not, you may need to move on and save your ammo for the bigger battle*…\n*the author fully acknowledges this is incredibly hard to do and SUCKS big time.\nPerseverance is key\nJigsaws take time. Once you’ve got all the edge pieces sorted (the big picture), filling in the rest will take patience and perseverance. Some pieces will be easy, other times you’ll spend ages looking and not see what’s right in front of your faces.\nBD and sales campaigns share a lot of synergies with jigsaw puzzles. Pulling together the big picture is relatively simple. Executing that big picture by filling in the missing bits is anything but. Here’s three tips for getting the job done:\n•\tStick to the plan: it’s common in professional services to get distracted by something new and shiny before the current activity has been completed. Make sure you see your plan out to its logical conclusion and develop SMART metrics to allow you to measure success.\n•\tGet a different view: when you’re head down on an activity, your thinking and perspective can become too narrow. If you’re facing a challenge on a particular aspect of your project, ask a colleague to provide their view. It just might unlock what is required to move on.\n•\tKeep going: at times, the challenge will appear insurmountable. When this happens, get away from your screen and head out for some fresh air. Whether it’s at home or in the office, take 15-20min to gather your thoughts on how to attack the problem anew, one piece at a time. Don’t give up – it’ll be worth it in the end.  \n \n11/11/24 – A job well done\nLast week we were having a chat in the (virtual) LINAR office about hairdressers. Three of the team have had the same hairdresser for years. When quizzed as to why this was the case, one of the team summarised:\nI’ve been going to the same bloke for 15 years. I walk in, get treated warmly, asked whether I want a coffee, water, beer. I sit down and am asked, “The Usual?” 30 mins later I walk out with a good haircut for a decent price. It’s always the same service with some great chat thrown in. He now does all my kids’ hair too.\nAs an industry, we like to overcomplicate things in professional services marketing. Elongated plans and campaigns, lavish events and time-consuming directories (did we mention we can simply that for you? – visit the Directorease site). \nThis means we can overlook the simple and effective ways to retain and win customers – by doing a bl00dy good job.\nThis week’s Three Thing’s focuses on just that – a job well done – and how to maximise the feelings that brings for a customer. Enjoy.\nDWYSYDWYSYDI: a simple phrase that just rolls of the tongue, right?. It stands for Do What You Say You’ll Do, When You Say You’ll Do It. Sounds simple. In reality, many professional services firms fall at this very basic first hurdle. We’ve lost count of the number of pieces of client feedback we’ve received from firms’ clients citing a basic lack of communication and keeping them updated on project and fee deadlines. \nAs in the hairdresser example above, reliability is a key component of building trust with someone and an integral part of David Maister’s trust equation. Think of companies like Amazon, McDonalds, Apple and others who all place reliability incredibly high up in the brand promise. This results in significant customer loyalty as people know what they are buying and trust the product before it’s even arrived.\nDon’t waste the goodwill \nDoing a good job is one thing. Those operators who are smart utilise the opportunity to build on their already strong position. Don’t lose the buzz the customer is feeling following a job well done. Consider the following: \n•\tGet the bill paid ASAP: the numbers always seem less with a successful outcome ringing in the ears!\n•\tFeedback: use the opportunity to ask for feedback on the job completed and, importantly, anything that could be done better next time. A lessons learned session can not only bond teams more tightly together but can also uncover efficiencies on both sides that will enhance the next job and increase the probability of another successful outcome. \n•\tAsk for a testimonial: use the goodwill to ask for a testimonial from your customer. Work with them to identify exactly what it was that made the job a success and ask them to commit it to video and/or paper.\nWhat next? \nParticularly in the legal industry, it’s all too common for deal teams to finish one job and move straight on, keen for the next adrenaline hit. Once the chaos has died down, get a wider relationship catch up in. Steer the conversation around to the next six months for the customer, what’s on their plate and how could you assist. \nAnd finally…\nWe’re working with the law firm Cripps at the moment. In the lead up to the UK budget recently, the Cripps corporate team closed over 20 deals in 24hrs ahead of the budget announcements on Wednesday 30th October. This herculean effort is likely to have saved Cripps clients many £m’s in Capital Gains Tax (CGT). Doing a good job when your clients are relying on you is some of the best BD going.\n \n18/11/24 -Nearly there…\nThere’s 30 business days to go in 2024. This figure becomes even less for most as folk take well earned Christmas breaks, recover from Christmas parties (read inability to make buying decisions) and try to wrap up their existing book of work meaning less time for new opportunities.\nHOWEVER, year end presents a fantastic opportunity for a last push to engage with your customers and position yourself for a strong start to 2025.\nThree Things this week is all about the last push towards revenue at the end of a fantastic 2024. Keep your foot on the accelerator and chase everything down before the turkey gets carved. Enjoy. \nYear end bargains\nFor those customers that align their financial year with the calendar year, now’s the time to offer irresistible packages and help them spend their remaining budget before it disappears on 01 Jan 2025. Here’s some thoughts on how to achieve this:  \n•\tCreate value combos: group complementary services into a single, discounted package to make purchasing decisions easy. For example, bundle planning advice with project management support for development clients.  \n•\tTailor the offer: use customer insights to craft personalised bundles that address their specific goals and challenges. For example, if a big project is kicking off in 2025, is there a way to stage the project and front load some of the costs to be paid with remaining 2024 budget?  \n•\tAdd a sweetener: Offer limited-time bonuses, like a free consultation or additional support, to create urgency and close deals faster. Apply a 2024 payment discount for all opportunities signed and/or invoices paid before 31 December 2024.\nNaughty or nice?  \nAs we move towards the endless Now That’s What I Call Christmas played on repeat in every shop and supermarket across the country, channel your inner turmoil and categorise your customers to focus your efforts:  \nNice customers: Loyal and high-value leads deserve your best efforts. Personalise your outreach with tailored holiday messages or quick catch-up calls.  \nNaughty customers: Ghosters or slow movers might still come around with a friendly nudge. Try a message like, “Before the year wraps up, I’d love to discuss how we can support your team’s goals for 2025.”  \nWildcards: These are the undecided ones. Use festive goodwill to re-engage with a simple gesture, like sharing a helpful industry tip or inviting them to a January planning call.\n2025 planning  \nIn between the mulled wine and corporate Christmas jumper competition, use December to set yourself up for success in 2025:  \n•\tBook January catch ups now: lock in meetings before diaries fill up. A quick “Let’s catch up early in the year to map out 2025 opportunities” can do the trick. Even better, give your top five customers a call – it’s much harder to turn down a voice!  \n•\tDust off the crystal ball: predictions on what’s going to happen in 2025 are a great way to engage customers. What trends do you anticipate? How will the services and products you deliver support your customers to navigate the 2025 landscape? Get these predictions ready to go during December.  \n•\tReflect, rest and reset: Take stock of your successes and lessons learned in 2024. What should you stop, start, and continue? Use these insights to hit the ground running next year. \nWhether it’s bundling up value, deciding who’s naughty or nice, or planning your next steps, a little extra effort now can make a big impact. Let’s finish strong and start the New Year with a bang!  \nEnjoy the festive season – and remember, success loves preparation.  \n \n23/12/24 – That’s a (123 Thing) wrap\nWhen I started LINAR, we had to establish a presence in an already saturated professional services consultant’s market. We needed a way to consistently stay front of mind across our target customer base.\nThe Three Things concept began years ago at a previous employer and was devised as a mechanism for reminding (nudging) busy professionals to remember their sales and BD responsibilities.\nRepurposed and rebranded, over the past 12 months:\n•\tOver 25,000 words have been written\n•\tProviding 123 actionable Things to do first thing on a Monday morning\n•\tVia 41 Three Things newsletters\nWe’ve had some great feedback so far and built an active readership base of over 150 BD & sales professionals across the market. There’s still work to do though to improve and refine our topics and delivery mechanisms. Please do get in touch if there are topics you'd like us to cover in 2025.\nAs you know, we’ve spent the last six months trying out various AI platforms on your behalf. Google’s Notebook LM is right up there for us.\nSo, here it is. 12 months of Three Things summarised into a 32 minute podcast. That’s only 21 minutes (3.5 units of time) if you listen on 1.5x speed (recommended).\nEnjoy. And thanks for tuning in this year! \n\n \n06/01/25 – the coiled spring\nFrom everyone in the LINAR team, WELCOME to 2025! What a year it’s shaping up to be with opportunities galore and exciting times ahead. But enough about us!\nOn a cold, wet and blustery Monday morning in the UK, it’s likely that many of you reading this are back at work for the first time since Christmas (no one counts the couple of hours you “logged on” in between). So, we hear you when you tell us the struggle is real, and the Mojo has not yet resurfaced from the festive break.\nThis week, let’s keep things simple. Three easy, practical ways to set yourself up for success in 2025 and an offer you can’t refuse to get your sales & BD mojo back. \nEnjoy. And never forget:\n \"You miss 100% of the shots you don't make.\"\nWayne Gretsky\nLeave no stone unturned \nGo back through the pitches and proposals you made in 2024. Do you know the outcomes for all of them, big or small? If not, now is the perfect opportunity to follow up with those clients who still owe you an answer. Keep it simple: \n“Happy New Year, hope you’re well. Just doing some New Year pipeline housekeeping and noticed I never received a response in relation to [xxxxxxxxx]. Do you still need help with that project? Keen to get involved and discuss your plans for 2025. Let me know.”\nShould do the trick and may well get your year off to a flyer! If not, it provides a hook for a coffee / call on other 2025 opportunities. A New Year win win.\nPersonal chest beating session\nWhen you need a break from the screen, sit down with an old fashioned pen & paper (or use SuperWhisper if you’re out with the dog) and write yourself a list of all the things you did well and/or were proud of last year. Don’t limit yourself to work achievements, throw everything in there. If you’re working from home, and you have one, ask your other half what you did well.\nOnce it’s all down, make yourself a nice brew and read through your list three times. The following things are likely to happen. Don’t be alarmed – this is entirely natural.\n1.\tYou may experience a warm feeling in your chest that rises up and can, at times, lead to a flushing of cheeks.\n2.\tAn inadvertent smile might form on your face and become tricky to remove for an extended period.\nWhilst taking these moments to bask in your own personal highlight reel for 2024, consider which of the work activities that made you smile can be repeated / enhanced in 2025.  \nDiarise your revenue\nIn our experience, most salespeople know their numbers (targets) inside out and back to front. Most professionals, sadly, do not, despite the fact that they all have financial targets they are renumerated against.\nBelow is a simple way to break down your 2025 from a numbers perspective. We’ve also provided a rough calc on how many opportunities will be required to hit your targets. Planning in this way provides an easy and measurable set of personal KPIs to gauge how your year is going.\nBut how do you generate those leads and opportunities? One quick and cost effective way is to sign up to our 1:2:1 BD reset programme. 90 mins of personalised tips, tricks and a 12 month BD plan. For January only, we’ve slashed the price by 50% to only £250! You’d be mad not to! \n \n \n  \n \n13/01/25 – We’d love to use you but…\nLet’s face it – things are going to be tough this year. Rachel Reeves and her mates in the UK Government delivered an October budget that is adding to the cost of doing business. As a result, all expenditure will be heavily scrutinised to ensure Value For Money (VFM) and we suspect most customers will ask for 3+ quotes for all material spend.\nPricing can be one of the trickiest parts of professional services. Customers often push back, ask for discounts, or get hung up comparing quotes. So, how do you handle these conversations without immediately slashing your fees or losing the deal? \nThis week’s Three Things tackles common pricing challenges and how to respond with intelligence and confidence. Enjoy!\n“We’d love to work with you, but your price is too high.”\nThe first and golden rule for answering most pricing challenges:\nDO NOT AGREE AND OFFER A DISCOUNT!\nTake this as a positive statement—your service offering has appeal, and the customer is genuinely interested. Instead of immediately rushing to lower your price, take the opportunity to reframe the conversation around value.\nSuggested response:  \nPART ONE: “That’s great to hear. Why would you love to work with us? What specific aspects impress you the most?” \nThe aim here is to get the customer to reinforce why they want to work with you (and not the competition) and to move the conversation away from price and more towards value.\nOnce this value is established, move the conversation onto their pricing concerns.\nPART TWO: “May I ask what specifically you feel is too high? Is it the upfront cost, the scope, or something else?”  \nWhen you understand their concern, use it as an opportunity to highlight what’s included: “Our pricing reflects the comprehensive support and expertise we provide. For example, we offer [specific feature or benefit], which ensures [key outcome].”  \nIf price remains a sticking point, consider revisiting the scope of the work: “We can discuss refining the scope to focus on your most pressing priorities—let’s ensure we align this to your budget and goals.”\nAvoid the “apples to oranges” trap  \nCustomers comparing your price to others might not realise they’re evaluating entirely different offerings. During any pricing discussion your job is to ensure they understand the added value of your proposal.\nSuggested response:  \n“It’s great that you’re exploring options—it’s always good to compare. That said, pricing only tells part of the story. Let me walk you through what’s included in our proposal, so we can ensure you’re comparing apples to apples.”  \nUse this moment to clarify extras your competitors may not include: “For example, our service includes [ongoing support, proactive advice, bespoke customisation, etc.], which helps avoid [common customer pain point].”  \nThis approach shifts focus from the price tag to the quality, outcomes, and long-term value your service provides.\n“Can you give us a discount?”\nAh, the classic discount request. Remember, it’s your customers right to chance their arm and see if you’ll lower your price. An instant reduction will signal to your customer that your initial price was likely too high if you’re giving away margin so freely and may well leave a sense of overpricing. Instead of reflexively saying “yes,” consider what you can offer that maintains value while keeping your integrity intact.\nSuggested response:  \n“Let’s explore what we can do to make this work for both of us. If budget is a concern, we could adjust the scope of work slightly to better align with your priorities.”  \nAlternatively, offer concessions that don’t hurt your margins:  \n•\tFaster payment terms in exchange for a modest discount.  \n•\tA phased approach, where some elements are delayed for cost savings.  \n•\tAdditional value-added services, like a follow-up consultation or training session, that emphasise your commitment.  \nWhere a discount is absolutely necessary, frame it as a one-off: “I’m happy to extend this adjustment for this project because we’re keen to build a relationship. For future work, our standard rates would apply.”\nFailure to make this clear to your customer will cause significant challenges for your next job where they will expect to pay your discounted rate forever more!\nFinal Thoughts  \nPricing challenges aren’t about the numbers—they’re about perception. Reframe the conversation around value, ensure customers understand what they’re truly paying for, and hold your ground on discounts by showing flexibility where it matters most.  \nNow go out there, set your fees with confidence, and make your value unmistakable!   \n20/01/25 – the art of giving\nA few months ago, I was in an Uber with the family after a great day out and managed to leave my phone in the chaos after arriving back at the house. However, I didn’t realise this until a knock on the door 30 mins after getting home. It was the Uber driver, who had found my phone and had driven back to ensure I got it back. \nI hugged him. And then felt good about life for the rest of the evening. \nIn the world of professional services, where relationships are the bedrock of success, there’s one principle that stands out as both timeless and powerful: reciprocity. Giving freely—your time, insights, templates—without expecting anything in return might seem counterintuitive, but it’s a game-changer in sales and business development. \nThree Things this week explains why giving is so powerful and the positive consequences it can have. Go on, give it a try. You might just find your next big opportunity is only one act of generosity away. Enjoy.\n1. Trust builder\nPsychologist Robert Cialdini’s research shows that humans are hardwired to return favours. His principle of reciprocity reveals why even small acts of generosity can transform relationships. \n“By obligating us to future repayment of favours, gifts, and the like, reciprocity allows one individual to give something to another with confidence that it is not being lost,” \nThe key point to note here is that reciprocity ≠ instant gratification. Be aware, your generosity may not be repaid for a while, or never. However, most people who are the recipient of your generosity will remember your act with positivity. \nExample: with new customers you have not previously worked with, give away more than you would usually feel comfortable doing. Spend time really thinking about their requirements and offer to sit down and discuss them at length. Provide outlines, templates or checklists for free. These actions will generate two things:\n1.\tPositivity towards you/ your organisation as you are providing something of value at no charge.\n2.\tA clear demonstration of your capabilities in your chosen area that your customer will remember next time they require this type of service.\n2. Authenticity  \nHere’s the magic of reciprocity: it works best when you give with no strings attached. If your generosity feels transactional, customers will see right through it. Genuine acts of giving create goodwill and often yield returns in unexpected ways. As Adam Grant notes in Give and Take, \n“Givers succeed in a way that creates a ripple effect, enhancing the success of people around them.”  \nExample: jump in with both feet to help and support when your customer(s) are under pressure. Consider how you can assist particular pinch points through micro secondments or virtual support. As your customers major deadlines approach, offer to independently review work product.   \n3. Be generous early\n“The beauty of reciprocity is that it builds trust and relationships before the ask.” Cialdini\nGenerosity isn’t just feel-good fluff—it delivers real business results. Dan Ariely’s Predictably Irrational explains how “free” triggers an emotional response that builds stronger connections.  \nIn sales and BD theory terms, your selfless acts to support a customer is a clear demonstration of your lack of self orientation in David Maister’s Trust equation which will lead to a strengthening of the trust they have in you.\nExample: spend your own time thinking about your customer’s business and, in particular, how macro factors (changes in regulation, a lunatic entering the white house, increased national insurance contributions etc) might affect them going forwards. Send them a note with suggestions on how to address these challenges and offer to sit down and run them through your suggestions.\nFinal thought  \nReciprocity is about creating genuine connections. Give without keeping score, and trust that your generosity will come back to you in surprising ways. As Cialdini says, “This is not manipulation; it’s human connection at its finest.”  \nSo, what will you give this week? Whether it’s a resource, advice, or just a little extra time, take the leap—and see how it transforms your relationships.  \n\n \n27/01/25 – Budget season\nDisclaimer: the authors can confirm that NO advice was taken from any member of the Labour party in putting this budget advice together.\nIt’s that time of year again—budgeting season. The period where spreadsheets multiply, partners stake their claims, and marketing and BD teams battle to stretch their $/£/€ further than humanly possible. If you’re knee-deep in budgeting discussions (or dodging them), we’ve got three key things you should be thinking about when allocating your marketing and BD spend for 2025-2026. Apart from instructing us that is 😉. Enjoy\n1. The 70/30 Rule – Give yourself some breathing space\nLet’s be honest—if your budget is 100% allocated before the year even starts, you’re already on the back foot. The market moves fast, and so should you. Whether it’s regulatory changes, surprise opportunities, or, dare we say it, the next big AI breakthrough, having an unallocated portion of your budget, for unexpected but good BD, is critical.\nAim to allocate 70% to planned initiatives and leave 30% flexible for the unknown. This allows you to pivot, experiment, and respond to opportunities you can’t yet see—because let’s face it, the only certainty in professional services is uncertainty.\n2. Data, Not Ego – Breaking the cycle of inertia\nIf your budgeting discussions sound a bit like “we’ve always done it this way” or “X partner likes it” or “let’s give [insert completely pointless marketing exercise] it another year”  then congratulations—you’ve fallen into the inertia trap. Too many marketing and BD decisions are based on habit or partner preferences rather than hard evidence.\nIt’s time to put data in the driving seat. Review last year’s initiatives—what actually delivered ROI? Which events, campaigns, and initiatives converted into meaningful client relationships and revenue? Make 2025 the year you say no to vanity projects and yes to strategies backed by cold, hard data. It might mean bruising a few egos, but your budget (and your sanity) will thank you. And, let’s face it, who doesn’t like bruising partner egos?\n3. People vs. Tech – Striking the right balance\n[Insert Meridian West data]\nYes, AI is the shiny new toy, but without training it’s akin to put a learner driver behind the wheel of an F1 racing car. The temptation to throw budget at the latest tech trend is real, but it’s important to strike a balance. Sure, invest in tools that automate repetitive tasks and streamline processes, but don’t neglect the human touch that builds lasting relationships. Let’s not forget—people still buy from people meaning that building the basics of BD & Sales (like the CPR of sales) are equally as important as the new, shiny thing.  \nSmart firms will allocate budget to both—tech to enhance efficiency and free up time, and people-driven initiatives (lawyer & BD team training, customer feedback programmes, industry roundtables, relationship-building) to deepen trust and generate meaningful opportunities. It’s not a choice of either/or, it’s about finding the sweet spot.\nBudgeting checklist\nSo, as you tackle your budget, remember:\n•\tLeave some wiggle room (70/30 rule),\n•\tLet data—not egos—drive decisions,\n•\tAnd balance tech with the good old human touch.\nNow, off you go—those spreadsheets won’t fill themselves.\n\n \n03/02/25 – the training haircut\nThe economy’s looking a bit shaky. Budget holders are twitchy. “Non-essential” spend is being scrutinised. And what’s often the first thing to get the chop? Training.\nBut here’s the thing—when times are tough, your people need to SELL. And if they’re not regularly sharpening their skills, they’ll struggle. In our view, the best BD and sales training is a constant – regular sessions that promote positive reinforcement of simple and repeatable processes. It’s like going to the gym—if you don’t keep at it, you’ll lose your strength (and let’s face it, most lawyers aren’t Arnold Schwarzenegger to start with).\nThis week’s Three Things is all about why now is the worst time to cut training out of next year’s budget. \nEnjoy.\n________________________________________\n1. In-person training boosts engagement and retention\nZoom fatigue is real. We all know that glazed-over look when someone’s pretending to listen while secretly scrolling through their emails. In-person training forces people to engage properly, practice real world scenarios, and get instant feedback—none of which happens effectively when they’re half-distracted at home.\nRoleplays, live discussions, and on-the-spot problem-solving create muscle memory for BD and sales. You simply can’t replicate the energy and learning impact of a proper, interactive session over a Teams call.\n________________________________________\n2. Culture-building, camaraderie, and war stories\nIn the good old days (pre-2020), teams naturally picked up sales tips and tricks from each other—whether in the office kitchen, at client events, or over a pint. But with hybrid working, those informal learning moments are happening less and less.\nGetting people in a room together isn’t just about training—it’s about learning from each other. The best BD insights come from the war stories of colleagues who’ve been there, done it, and know what works. Sales success in professional services isn’t just about individual effort; it’s about knowing who in the firm can help, how to cross-sell effectively, and which approaches actually get results.\nFrequent, in-person training creates those moments where people swap stories, share wins and failures, and learn from each other’s experiences—something you can’t replicate through a one-off webinar.\n________________________________________\n3. The false economy of cutting training\nTightening budgets might seem sensible, but cutting BD and sales training in a downturn is like deciding to save money by skipping client meetings—short-term gain, long-term pain.\nWhen the economy wobbles, the work doesn’t just walk through the door. Firms need to be more proactive in winning business, not less. And that means ensuring that EVERY lawyer —junior to senior—has the opportunity to build their confidence in selling their expertise.\nThe firms that will struggle most in the next year? The ones that wait until business dries up before realising their people aren’t equipped to bring in new work. By then, it’s too late.\n________________________________________\nFinal thought\nBD training isn’t a nice-to-have; it’s a necessity. And like going to the gym, one session won’t do it—you need to keep at it to stay in shape. The firms that invest in their people now will be the ones winning work while everyone else is playing catch-up.\nSo, if you’re cutting training to save money, just ask yourself—how much is it going to cost you in lost revenue down the line?\n \n10/02/25 – the competition\n“Know thy enemy and know yourself, and you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.” Sun Tzu, The Art of War\nYour competition isn’t just \"that lot down the road\" – they’re a goldmine of insights, tactics, and inspiration (or what not to do). Keeping tabs on them isn’t about paranoia; it’s about being prepared. \nThis week we dive into three ways you can keep an eye on the competition and stay ahead of the game (without needing a trench coat and dark sunglasses). Enjoy.\n1. Stalk smart (legally, of course!)\nNo, we’re not suggesting you loiter outside their office with a pair of binoculars (tempting as that may be), but a little smart digital digging can go a long way. Keep an eye on:\n•\tTheir website: What’s new? Have they launched a shiny new service, published thought leadership pieces, or recruited new rainmakers?\n•\tSocial media: Follow them on LinkedIn and X. Take note of their content and how much traction it's getting. Are they raking in likes while your posts gather tumbleweeds?\n•\tGoogle Alerts: Set up alerts for their name to get notified of any mentions in the press or new announcements. (And no, checking it every five minutes won’t make a difference!)\nOur recommendation: Spend 15 minutes a week reviewing their content and identifying trends. What are they talking about that you’re not? What’s their tone? Learn and adapt accordingly.\n2. Mystery shop like a pro\nEver wondered what it’s like to be on the receiving end of your competitors’ services? A bit of good old-fashioned ‘mystery shopping’ can be an eye-opener. Download their reports, sign up for their webinars, and experience firsthand how they woo their prospects.\nThings to look out for:\n•\tHow quickly do they follow up? Are they onto you in minutes, or do they leave you hanging like a bad date?\n•\tWhat’s their tone? Friendly and approachable or as dry as a contract clause?\n•\tAre they offering anything unique that makes you think, \"Why didn’t we think of that?!\"\nOur recommendation: Compile your findings and compare them with your own sales processes. Are you slower? Less engaging? More vanilla? Make adjustments accordingly.\n3. Stay close to your clients\nYour clients are your best source of intel – and your competitors know it too. Regular catch-ups can reveal who else is knocking on their door and what they’re whispering through the keyhole.\nBe brave and ask:\n•\t“What are our competitors doing well that we’re not?”\n•\t“Have you seen anything interesting from other firms recently?”\n•\t“Is there anything we could be doing better to support you?”\n•\t“What’s keeping you up at night?” \nOur recommendation: Use client feedback to fine-tune your approach and pre-empt competitor moves. If they’re offering something cheaper, faster, or more personalised, you need to know – and counter it with your own brilliance.\nFinal thought\nKeeping tabs on the competition doesn’t mean becoming obsessed; it means using them as a benchmark to push your own BD efforts further. Stay informed, stay proactive, and most importantly – stay ahead.\n\n \n17/02/25 – diversity\nDiversity in professional services isn’t just about ticking a box or looking good in the annual ESG report. It’s about winning more work, building stronger client relationships, and ultimately, selling more. The firms that grasp this are already reaping the commercial rewards. The ones that don’t? Well, they’re just making life harder for themselves.\nThe stats back this up. Research by Boston Consulting Group found that companies with above-average diversity in their leadership teams generate 19% more revenue from innovation than those with less diversity. (Read the full study here)\nThis week, we’re breaking down exactly why diversity makes sales teams sharper, smarter, and more successful—and what you can do today to make it work for you.\n\n1. Clients buy from people who ‘get’ them\nWhen clients look at your pitch team, they’re asking themselves: \"Do these people understand us?\" If your team all look the same, speaks the same, thinks the same and acts the same, you’re sending the wrong signal.\n🔍 The reality: Decision-making teams in major sectors like tech, finance, and retail are more diverse than ever. If your firm rolls out the same old lineup—same backgrounds, same perspectives—you risk looking out of touch.\n🚀 Do this today: For your next client meeting or pitch, check your team lineup. Does it reflect the diversity of the client? If not, mix it up. Bring in different voices from your firm to widen the perspective and build a stronger connection.\n\n2. Diverse teams = smarter selling\nDifferent backgrounds = different ways of thinking. Diverse teams challenge assumptions, ask better questions, and uncover opportunities others miss.\n🤝 The reality: Selling professional services isn’t about reciting a credentials list—it’s about understanding client pain points and solving their problems. Teams with varied perspectives are more agile, more creative, and more likely to spot hidden opportunities.\n🎯 Do this today: In your next BD meeting, challenge your team’s assumptions. Are you seeing the client’s problem through a single lens? Get fresh input from someone outside your usual sales circle.\n\n3. More perspectives = more deals closed\nThe numbers don’t lie. Diverse teams convert more leads into revenue because they bring fresh thinking and build stronger client trust.\n📊 The reality: A Boston Consulting Group study found that firms with diverse leadership teams generate nearly 20% more innovation revenue than less diverse competitors. Why? Because fresh perspectives lead to better problem-solving and stronger relationships.\n💡 Do this today: If your sales pipeline is stuck, bring in a different voice. Get input from colleagues in different practice areas, with different experiences, and watch how the conversation shifts.\n\nThe bottom line: difference sells\nDiversity isn’t a nice-to-have—it’s a sales advantage. Clients want to work with teams that reflect their world, their challenges, and their values. The firms that embrace this will win more, sell more, and grow faster. The ones that don’t? They’ll keep wondering why they’re losing pitches to the competition.\n🚀 Final thought: Look at your next sales opportunity. Are you bringing a mix of perspectives to the table? If not, what’s stopping you?\n\n \n24/02/25 – Ultimate chaos\nIf you feel like the world’s gone a bit mad, you’re not alone. War in Ukraine, Trump back in the White House trying to play geopolitical chess, German elections shaking up Europe, and markets that can’t decide whether they’re coming or going—it’s chaos out there. But where there’s chaos, there’s opportunity.  \nFor many lawyers, accountants, and other professionals, the biggest challenge isn’t just keeping up—it’s knowing what to do with all this uncertainty. You’re trained to deal in facts, precedents, and clear answers. The problem? The world isn’t playing by those rules right now. We’re in a VUCA world—Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, and Ambiguous—and customers are looking for someone who can help them navigate it.  \nSo, how do you turn macro madness into meaningful conversations with clients? Here are three things to get you started. Enjoy.  \n1. Get comfortable with uncertainty  \nYou’re never going to have all the answers. And that’s fine—because neither do your customers. The real skill is knowing how to help them ask the right questions. Instead of trying to predict the future (good luck with that), focus on providing perspective:  \n•\t\"How are you thinking about risk in this environment?  \n•\t\"What’s keeping you up at night with these market shifts?\"  \n•\t\"Where do you see potential threats or opportunities in your sector?\"  \nYou’re not expected to be a political analyst or an economist, but you are expected to be someone who can help customers think through the implications.  \n2. Don’t wait - own the narrative  \nA lot of professionals make the mistake of waiting for customers to ask, \"What does this mean for us?\" before engaging. The best BD operators flip that on its head—they bring the conversation to the customer first. A simple email, LinkedIn post, or quick coffee chat can position you as someone who’s thinking ahead.  \n•\t\"We’re seeing a lot of customers in your industry start to prepare for [X]. Might be worth a quick chat on what that could mean for you.\"  \n•\t\"With Trump back in the White House, we’re already seeing shifts in trade policy. How’s that affecting your strategy?\"  \nCustomers don’t need all the answers right now. What they do need is to know you’re thinking ahead for them.  \n3. Make VUCA work for you – and your pipeline  \nVUCA is a nightmare for anyone looking for stability, but for sales? It’s a goldmine. Why? Because uncertainty forces businesses to rethink strategies, revisit risk, and (crucially) seek advice. Positioning yourself as a trusted advisor during these moments is what turns conversations into opportunities.  \n•\tRun a quick roundtable or webinar on \"What [Insert Current Event] Means for [Your Industry]\"  \n•\tIdentify three customers who will be most affected by a major geopolitical shift and proactively reach out\n•\tUse uncertainty as a reason to revisit dormant customers: \"Given everything going on, let’s have a catch-up to see how things are shaping up on your end.\"  \nBottom line? The world isn’t getting any less chaotic anytime soon. But if you can help customers navigate the uncertainty, you won’t just be someone who reacts to the news—you’ll be the one they call first when it breaks.  \nNow, go and make VUCA your sales & BD superpower.\n \n03/03/25 - Make deals, not war\nGo to a plumber’s house and the taps leak. Visit the electrician’s house and the light switch doesn’t work. Observe a high performing corporate M&A partner trying to win a piece of work for themselves and they turn to jelly. Why?\nNegotiation. It’s the part of sales that turns even the most confident professionals into sweaty-palmed wrecks. But it doesn’t have to be painful. With the right approach, you can close deals on your terms while keeping customers happy.\nThe key? Stay calm, professional, and strategic. You don’t want to end up in a heated exchange that makes headlines for all the wrong reasons—just ask Donald Trump and President Zelensky. Keep your cool, focus on value, and don’t let ego derail a good deal. \nHere’s how. Enjoy.\n1. Know your value – and own It\nIf you don’t believe in your value, why should your customer? Before stepping into any negotiation, be crystal clear on:\n✅ The unique benefits you bring.\n✅ The outcomes your customer will achieve.\n✅ Your absolute bottom line—where you will not go lower. Top tip – make sure EVERYONE in your team knows where this line is!\n💰 Considering a discount? Reduce the scope. Never just knock money off for no reason—that only tells the customer you overpriced it in the first place. Instead, say:\n\"We can adjust the price, but we’ll need to reduce X and Y to reflect that.\"\nThis ensures you keep control of the deal rather than just slicing your margins for the sake of closing.\n2. Play the long game – It’s not just about price\nSome customers will hammer you on price. Don’t get angry – they have a right to do this and an obligation to get the best deal for their organisation. Instead of immediately caving:\n🔄 Talk about long-term value—position yourself as a strategic partner, not a one-off purchase.\n🔧 Offer phased pricing or service bundles to reshape the discussion.\n🤫 Use silence. State your case, then stop talking. You’d be amazed how often people fill the gap by backtracking on their own objections.\n3. Know when to walk away (and how to make them think twice)\nNot every deal is worth doing. If a customer is grinding you down to a point where it’s no longer viable, be prepared to walk. Remember where your bottom line is (see above) and stick to it. Otherwise you’re in very real danger of entering a race to the bottom.  \nBut instead of just saying “no,” try this:\n🤷‍♂️ Recommend a cheaper, substandard competitor.\n\"If budget is the main concern, you could look at [Competitor X]—they’re lower cost, though they do things differently to us.\"\n💡 Nobody likes to feel like they’re a cheapskate. This technique makes them re-evaluate whether saving a few quid is worth the risk.\nNegotiation isn’t about winning or losing—it’s about getting to the right deal. Stand your ground, play smart, and don’t sell yourself short. \nOh, and probably best to conduct the negotiation behind closed doors and not in front of the world’s media!\n\n \n10/03/25 – Spring cleaning\nAfter a cracking UK weekend, we can dare to believe that spring is in the air. While you’re clearing out your garage and wondering how many mismatched Tupperware lids one household actually needs, it’s time to turn that decluttering energy to your sales pipeline. Is it full of forgotten leads, customers who vanished into the ether, and deals that are going nowhere? \nIn our experience, regular and consistent pipeline management (just 15 mins per week) promotes good BD & sales habits and avoids the dreaded “pending” outcome (which isn’t really an outcome). Ancillary benefits include providing a reason to reconnect with existing contacts and, in some cases, winning work you otherwise thought was lost.   \nTime for a deep clean! Enjoy. \n1. Cut the deadwood \nSome deals have been lurking in your pipeline so long they should be paying rent. “Pending” is not an outcome – it’s the equivalent of sand in your gearbox, grinding everything to a halt. If a customer has gone quiet for months, it’s time to call it:\n🚫 Close the opportunity—but tell them first. Instead of waiting indefinitely, send a final email saying you’re shutting the file.\n💡 Reverse psychology works—people don’t like doors closing on them! You’ll be surprised how often this prompts a response.\nTry this:\n\"Hi [Customer], I wanted to follow up one last time before we close out this opportunity. Since we haven’t had a decision, we assume now isn’t the right time. If that changes, let us know. Wishing you all the best!\"\nIf they don’t bite, move on. No more pipeline clutter.\n2. Follow up or file away\nNot every quiet customer is a lost cause. Some just need a nudge. Work through your list and:\n📞 Call (preferably) or email: “Still interested? Let’s chat.” Don’t forget, you’ve earned the right to follow up on the basis you put so much effort into the opportunity in the first place.\n📝 If they say “not right now,” set a reminder for three months to check in again.\n⏳ If they’re still stalling after that, they’re probably deadwood (see point one).\nA structured follow-up process stops leads from slipping through the cracks—and keeps you top of mind.\n3. Restock the funnel\nNow that you’ve cleared out the clutter, it’s time to refill your pipeline. And the best place to start? Customers you’ve worked with before but haven’t done business with in a while. One of the best 30mins you can spend it to go through your practice management system and list all of the customers you have worked with in the previous 24 months but have not spoken to yet this year. \n🛠️ These people already know you, trust you, and liked your work—so re-engage them first.\n📆 Drop them a note: “It’s been a while! What’s on your radar for this year? Let’s catch up.”\n📊 Beyond that, look at networking events, LinkedIn engagement, and other ways to bring in new opportunities.\nSpring is all about renewal—so make sure your sales pipeline reflects that!\n\n \n17/03/25 – When the going gets tough….\nTimes are tough in the UK at the moment. When the market is down, and customers are clutching their wallets like it’s their last fiver, sales becomes a different game. You’re not just selling a service anymore—you’re selling certainty, risk reduction, and survival. \nThis week’s Three Things provides guidance on techniques to sharpen your sales strategy in tough times. Enjoy.   \n1. The \"Pain First\" approach  \nSell aspirin, not vitamins. In a downturn, customers aren’t buying \"nice to have\" services—they’re focused on solving immediate pain points. So, instead of pitching broad benefits, hone in on their biggest current problem and show how your service is a direct solution.  \nHow to do it:  \n•\tStart customer conversations with: \"What’s keeping you up at night?\"  \n•\tUse urgency-led messaging: \"This will reduce your cash leakage by 20% in the next three months.\"  \n•\tIf they say “Not now”, reframe: “If not now, then when? What will change in 6 months that isn’t possible today?”  \nPeople will always pay for relief—position your service as the painkiller.  \n2. The Trojan horse strategy  \nWhen customers are cost-conscious, getting a foot in the door is everything. Instead of pushing a full-service engagement, offer a low-cost, low-risk entry point, a gateway drug —something that gets them working with you now, so you can expand later.  \nHow to do it:  \n•\tOffer a diagnostic or audit service —a one-off analysis of their current situation.  \n•\tProvide a quick-win pilot project with clear results in 30 days.  \n•\tSell a fixed-fee package that removes pricing uncertainty.  \nOnce you’re in, show results fast—then position the next step as the obvious choice.  \n3. The price anchor play  \nPrice sensitivity skyrockets in a downturn, but that doesn’t mean you need to discount. Instead, use price anchoring—a psychological pricing technique—to make your core offer look like a no-brainer.  \nHow to do it:  \n•\tPresent three options: Gold, Silver, Bronze (hint: most buyers pick the middle).  \n•\tCreate contrast: Start with a premium offer that’s more expensive, before showing your core package—it’ll seem more affordable by comparison.  \n•\tOffer \"ROI-Based\" Pricing: If customers are hesitant, tie your fee to results—e.g., “If we don’t help you recover £X, you don’t pay.”  \n\nCustomers may be cautious, but they still spend on what they perceive as value—so shape the way they see it.  \nFinal Thought  \nIn boom times, customers buy to grow. In downturns, they buy to survive. Reframe your service to focus on risk reduction, efficiency, and resilience, and you’ll stay ahead while competitors flounder.  \nWhich of these techniques can you use this week? Let’s get selling.\n \n24/03/25 – once upon a time…\nOnce upon a Monday morning, in a relatively commutable land of glass lifts, grey carpet, and lukewarm coffee, a well-meaning but slightly under-the-radar professional named Alex* set off on a quest…\nWandering through the enchanted Corporate Forest (also known as HQ), Alex sought the secret to winning more customers. Not with spreadsheets. Not with bullet points. But with stories.\nAnd so began a journey of magical discovery.\n*other names are available.\n“Those who tell the stories rule the world.”\nHopi American Indian proverb\n1. Stories stick where stats slip  \nDeep in the Forest of Floor 14, Alex bumped into the Wizard of Engagement, who whispered:\n“The brain is wired for stories, not PowerPoint. Stats are useful, but stories are memorable. Next time you talk to a customer, don’t just say what you do. Tell them what you’ve done.”\n🧙‍♂️ Instead of:  \n“We reduced operational costs by 8%.”  \nTry:  \n“We worked with another business like yours that was juggling five different systems. We simplified it to one, saved them time, and helped their FD sleep better at night.”\n2. Collect your case studies like gold nuggets  \nAt the vending machine clearing (Level 3), the Adonis of Awesome Anecdotes (or Triple A to his mates) appeared, surrounded by shimmering case study scrolls.\n“You need stories ready to go. Not vague memories of 'a matter last year'. Write them down. Voice note them (we recommend SuperWhisper). Turn them into golden nuggets.”\n “But how?!” cried Alex. “My training has sucked the imagination right out of me.” \n💡 “Ahhhhh” said Triple A. “You need the three C’s”:\n•\tChallenge: What was the customer's situation?\n•\tChange: What did you do?\n•\tConsequence: What happened next?\nPull out box\nChallenge: Recently, one of our customers were delivering a bespoke solution each time — brilliant work, but impossible to scale.\nChange: We helped them turn their expertise into a repeatable product — a diagnostic toolkit + template playbook.\nConsequence: Within six months, they’d sold it to three new customers with zero delivery rework and doubled their margin.\nBonus quote: “It’s like we bottled lightning — and now we can sell it!”\n3. Make *them* the hero, not you  \nOn the mezzanine bridge, Alex met The Sage of the Second Act, a sharp-eyed strategist in a tailored cloak who beckoned him close and said in a hushed tone:\n“In every story, someone wins. If it’s always you, that’s not a story — it’s a humblebrag. Make your customer the hero. You’re the trusted guide, the Fairy BD-Mother, the Samwise to their Frodo, their Timone & Pumbaa.”\n🧠 Instead of:\n“We saved the deal.”\nTry:\n“We helped their COO make a case to the board — and they got the funding, and the internal kudos to go with it.”\nNot only is this more flattering (and accurate), but it shifts the story into their world. That’s where the magic happens.\nAnd then came the villain…  \nBut no tale is complete without a bit of drama.\nLurking in the shadow of a dull grey cubicle was Sir Inertia – the most stubborn of foes. His powers? Making customers say things like “We’ll think about it” or “Maybe next quarter”.\nAlex smiled. Because stories — real, human, powerful stories — were the one thing even Sir Inertia couldn’t ignore.\n🎤 The End. \nOr rather, the beginning…  \n \n31/03/25 – Myanmar\n\nDonate to the Red Cross appeal now.\nOver 1,700 people are confirmed dead following the 7.7 magnitude earthquake which took place in Myanmar last week.\nMany hundreds are still missing.\nThe humanitarian crisis unfolding is massive as aid agencies are desperately trying to get food and water to the affected areas.\nThe people of Myanmar are not worried about energy prices, weak economic markets, and a slowdown in business. They are worried at getting through today and making it into tomorrow.\nWe’ve donated £500 to the Red Cross Appeal and will match anyone’s donation up to another £500*.\nWe know it’s tough out there. Please dig deep and help out those less fortunate than yourself.\n*Simply send across proof of donation and we’ll match it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n07/04/25 – be the best (consistently)…\nService delivery is EVERYTHING. Think about your favourite restaurant. We’ll wager it’s not just about the food or the wine list, it’s the whole end to end experience from start to finish.\nIn professional services, it’s no different. Think you need to be a smooth talker or LinkedIn lurker to win new business? Rubbish. Some of the best business developers don’t sell at all—they serve. Deliver brilliant work, keep your promises, and the work will start chasing you. \nThis week’s Three Things describes how to turn excellent service into effortless sales. Enjoy.\n1. Be so good they can’t ignore you\nForget schmoozing. If you’re the team who delivers on time, on budget, and without a faff, you’ll become the person customer’s trust. And trust wins deals. No slick pitch deck. No golf days. Just good old-fashioned reliability and a reputation for getting the job done.\nWant to know the science behind it all? David Maister’s Trust Equation is the holy grail in professional services:\n\nTrust = (Credibility + Reliability + Intimacy) ÷ Self-Orientation.\n\nIn short: be competent, be dependable, be human—and don’t make it all about you. \n2. Make your customers look good\nIt’s not about you. It’s never about you. Your job is to make your customer the hero of the story.\nThat might mean:\n•\tGiving them a polished deck they can shamelessly drop into a board pack.\n•\tArming them with bulletproof talking points before a regulator meeting.\n•\tTurning your advice into a results-driven story they can share with their CFO.\nOne junior GC at a retail client was quietly handed the keys to the legal department after their external advisor helped them solve a messy shareholder row—and gave them the words to win internal support. Another compliance partner helped an in-house counsel become the firm’s go-to on operational resilience with a three-line email at just the right moment. That partner now gets all the firm’s regulatory work. Funny that.\nMake your client look brilliant, and they’ll make you indispensable.\n3. Spot the next problem\nThe best time to win the next bit of work? When you’re still high-fiving over the last one.\nYou’ve earned trust. You’ve got inside knowledge. Use it. A simple: “You know what we should be thinking about next?” can open doors to whole new projects.\nAnd here’s the secret weapon: active listening. Really tune in during assignments—catch those offhand remarks, the passing frustrations, the “we’ve been meaning to look at that” moments. That’s where your next proposal lives. The ability to hear what’s not being said—and gently help solve it—makes you more than a supplier. You become a strategist. A fixer. A mate.\nNeed help getting your team to turn delivery into demand? You know where we are. No pushy pitches. Just good advice, great training, and the occasional LEGO metaphor.\n \n14/04/25 – get over ghosting\n“Thanks for your email – I’ll get back to you shortly.” Customer, three months ago. Still waiting.\nRejection stings. Whether it’s a flat “no thanks” or just eerie silence after what felt like a great meeting, being blanked can really take the wind out of your sails. But in sales, rejection isn’t just common – it’s guaranteed.\nThis week’s Three Things is for anyone who’s ever sent a follow-up, checked their inbox 37 times, and quietly questioned their entire career. You’re not alone. Enjoy.\n1. You’re not the problem (well… probably not)  \nThat non-response? It’s almost never personal. Customers are juggling their own nonsense—budget freezes, turf wars, end of year performance reviews, inboxes that look like war zones.\nReframe the silence:\n•\tNot now ≠ never  \n•\tGhosted ≠ game over  \n•\tNo = a brilliant excuse to ask “Why?”\nAnd if your customer is kind and generous enough to provide you with genuine, actionable feedback and areas for improvement? Great. Learn, tweak, and move on. No sulking. No weird or desperate LinkedIn posts moaning about how rude your customers are.\n2. Stop sending emails into the abyss  \nWe’ve all done it. The sad, vague follow-up. But ghosting often happens because we’re just… boring. Here are five lines that should be banned immediately:\n1. “Just checking in to see if you had a chance to review…”  \nTranslation: I’ve got nothing new to say, but I’m desperate.\n2. “Hope this finds you well.”  \nNo one knows what this means. Stop it.\n3. “Circling back on this – any updates?”  \nFirstly, stop circling - you're not a seagull. If there were updates, they’d have told you.\n4. “Did you get my last email?”  \nYes. And they chose not to reply. Now you’ve reminded them and annoyed them.\n5. “Getting this to the top of your inbox.”  \nA personal pet hate. If it was important for them, it would already be there.\nInstead, try something like (once you've convinced yourself that the phone is just too scary):\n•\t“I’ve had another thought about how we could help with [insert client problem]. Fancy a quick chat this week?”\n•\t“We’ve just concluded a similar project for one of your peers and have a number of lessons learned which you might find useful. Can we discuss?”\n•\t“You mentioned [insert challenge] – here’s a short article that might help. Thought of you when I saw it.”\nBe useful. Be human. Be brief. Then move on.\n3. Build a better buffer  \nSales is a tough and brutal sport. It’s no coincidence the top of the sales funnel is much much wider than the bottom. Rejection will feel even more devastating when it’s your only lead. To mitigate the inevitable losses, you need to stack your pipeline so there are a variety of deals bubbling away at each stage of the cycle.\nBelow is a worked example of what could be considered a healthy pipeline. As a general rule of thumb, given that sales is generally part (not all) of the role our customers have, we’d recommend no less than five genuine opportunities in the mix at any one time. \nEXAMPLE\nLet’s say you want to close £50k in revenue in the next quarter. Your average contract value is £20k. That’s three deals you need to close.\n[Insert image]  \nMoral of the story? You don’t need 100% success. You just need volume, consistency, and a strategy. The next time someone ghosts you, update the CRM, wish them well, and keep moving.\nFinal thoughts  \n•\tYou’re not being ghosted because you’re terrible.  \n•\tYou’re being ghosted because follow-up is a skill.  \n•\tA strong pipeline is the best ghost repellent there is.\nWant help building a follow-up rhythm, or auditing your pipeline flow? You know where to find us. We never ghost.\n\n \n22/04/25 – First impressions\nWe’ve all been there. You’ve finally got some time in the diary with a prospect or existing customer. Coffee in hand, Teams camera on, you're all smiles... and then comes that awkward first minute.\nDo you dive straight in with “So... what keeps you up at night?”\nOr do you default to your very best Peter Kay impression and hope the floor opens up?\nFear not. This week’s Three Things is all about turning small talk into something that actually builds relationships – without sounding like a chatbot or your Auntie June at a wedding. Let’s go.\n________________________________________\n1. Ditch the “Busy?”\nThe goal of small talk isn’t to kill time – it’s to create connection. A strong opener shows you’re interested, human, and not just here to sell something.\nHere are five better ways to open a BD conversation:\n•\t“What’s been the highlight of your week so far?”\n(Gets them talking about something positive. Easy win.)\n•\t“What’s the one thing you wish you could outsource this week?”\n(Fun, disarming, and very revealing. Often exposes pressure points you can help with.)\n•\t“I saw on LinkedIn you were at [event] – how was it?”\n(Shows you’ve done your homework and gives them a stage.)\n•\t“Are you mostly in the office these days or hybrid chaos like the rest of us?”\n(Always gets a laugh. Often uncovers team or culture chat.)\n•\t“I always forget to ask – how did you end up doing what you do?”\n(Absolute gold if you want to understand what makes them tick.)\nThese work because they’re conversational, slightly unexpected, and get the other person talking early – which is exactly what you want.\n________________________________________\n2. Scan for ‘personal nuggets’\nWhen it comes to professional services, people still buy from people. Establishing a personal connection is a great way to build early trust with a potential customer. You don’t need to hire a PI to build rapport – just use what’s already out there:\n✅ LinkedIn clues\n•\tEducation? Shared uni? Same law school?\n•\tCareer path – ex-Big Four? Tech startup escapee?\n•\tPosts about pets, running, bake-offs, obscure rugby teams? Use it.\n✅ Zoom background bingo\n•\tKids’ artwork? Ask if they’ve got little ones.\n•\tFootball shirt? Ask who they support (but tread carefully).\n•\tBookshelf? Scan for titles or genres – even better if it’s business books and Harry Potter.\n✅ Shared experiences\n•\t“I think we were both at [industry event] last year – did you go to the evening session on XYZ?”\n•\t“I remember seeing your name on the panel list for [conference] – what did you make of it?”\nThe key here is to use what you notice to show interest – not to show off your detective skills.\n3. From chat to business without the cringe\nYou’ve found your rhythm, the conversation is flowing nicely, and now you want to steer into work stuff without jarring the tone. Here’s a tried and tested way to keep things moving along:\nSmall talk → Related insight → Soft pivot\nExample:\n“You mentioned your team’s been heads-down on integration – we’re seeing a lot of clients in that post-M&A pinch point. Are you having similar challenges on your side?”\nOr:\n“Since you said it’s been a mad start to the quarter, I wondered – are you seeing shifts in what’s hitting your desk, or is it business as usual?”\nThis isn’t a script. It’s a rhythm. And once you nail it, small talk becomes the launchpad for brilliant BD.\nFinal word? \nDon’t overthink it.\nThe most powerful thing you can do in the first 90 seconds is be genuinely curious. Smile, ask something half-decent, listen properly, and resist the urge to sell straight away.\nSmall talk. Big impact. Nailed it.\n \n28/04/25 – Celebrate good times (come on)\nAt LINAR, we love a good celebration. Not just because it usually involves beers and an excuse to down tools at 4pm, but because celebrating successes, big or small, is a powerful tool for building relationships and future business. And let’s face it. In the current environment, with everything that’s going off around the world, we all could do with a few more reasons to celebrate!\nThis week, three reasons why you need to get your party hat on. Enjoy!\nThank you also goes a long way. In that spirit, many thanks to our good friend @Owen Williams from Simmons who gave us the idea for this week’s topic.\n#1. Small wins = big impact\nToo often we barrel straight past victories, eyes already locked on the next project. But celebrating even the small stuff gives teams a sense of momentum, boosts morale, and creates the “we’re winning” feeling that builds loyalty internally and externally. Crushed a big piece of work? Won a mini pitch? Finally got the tech team to fix your email footer? Crack open the (cheap) Prosecco. Good vibes sell.\n#2. Celebrations build relationships \nA quick “thank you” drink, a shout-out on LinkedIn, or even a casual round of coffees can turn a functional working relationship into a proper partnership. People remember how you made them feel, not necessarily what you did. \nOr, as Maya Angelou famously put it:\n“People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.”\nCelebrate milestones with your customers and colleagues—birthdays, promotions, completed projects, their kid finally passing their driving test—you name it. It’s the little touches that count.\n#3. Gratitude is good for business \nCustomers and colleagues alike want to feel appreciated, not taken for granted. Publicly recognising contributions builds trust and increases the chance of repeat business (and referrals). Next time you finish a project, don’t just send the invoice—send the thank you note first. It’s also the perfect moment to ask for genuine, authentic feedback while the good vibes are still fresh. Even better, if the relationship allows, this is a great opportunity to ask for a testimonial that you can use across future marketing. (Then send the invoice. Then chase the invoice. Priorities).\nFinal thought\nCelebration doesn’t have to be grand. It just has to be genuine.\nNow, where’s that party playlist when you need it?\n\n \n06/05/25 – Here we go again!\nNew financial year, new target – and if you’re anything like most partners or senior lawyers we work with, your internal monologue probably sounds like:\n\n“£1.2m? Are they mad? That’s 1,200,000 actual pounds. That’s a lot of conveyancing…”\nBut fear not. Over the course of the next three week’s, we’re going to show you how to turn that £1.2m target into something a bit less panic inducing and a lot more manageable. Today we concentrate on figuring out your numbers and where you need to be by when. Enjoy.\n1. Eating an elephant \nThere’s only one way we’ve found to eat an elephant without getting chronic indigestion. You must break it down into manageable bitesize chunks. \nHow? Take your annual target – we’ll use £1.2m as our baseline – and break it into digestible monthly or quarterly chunks:\n•\tMonthly: £1.2m ÷ 12 = £100k per month\n•\tQuarterly: £1.2m ÷ 4 = £300k per quarter\nNow ask yourself – which rhythm suits your practice most? Corporate lawyers may think in quarters, litigators in phases, and private client teams in seasonal chaos. Either way, know your rhythm and map your revenue against it.\nThen go further – break down your performance last year by month or quarter. Any patterns? Peaks and troughs? Did September fly because of an M&A sprint? Was February dead due to ski season? Plot it out; forecasting starts with self-awareness, not spreadsheets.\n2. Who’s already contributing to your target?\nTargets are met in two ways: repeat work from existing clients, and new instructions from both existing and new clients. Time for a back-of-an-envelope audit:\nStart by asking:\n•\tWhat % of last year’s revenue came from existing clients?\n•\tIs it fair to assume the same this year?\nLet’s say 70% came from existing relationships. Apply that here:\n•\t70% of £1.2m = £840k from existing clients\n•\tThat leaves £360k to find elsewhere\nThis doesn’t need to be precise – you’re building a BD strategy, not submitting your tax return. A rough split provides an indication of where to focus. And if you realise your revenue is heavily reliant on two key clients – you’ve now got a concentration risk to manage too.\n3. Bringing home the bacon\nNow we get into the real maths. If you need to bring in £360k from new clients this year, you need to understand two things:\n•\tYour Average Contract Value (ACV) – what is a typical new matter worth?\n•\tYour conversion rates – how many leads become instructions?\nLet’s say your average matter is worth £30k. Then:\n•\t£360k ÷ £30k = 12 new instructions needed\n•\tThat’s 1 new matter a month on average\n•\tIf you’re converting one in four (25%) opportunities, firstly well done you and secondly, this means you need to be generating an opportunity every week to hit your target. \nFeeling queasy? Let’s tweak it. If your ACV is £60k, you only need six new clients all year. If it’s £10k, you’ll need thirty-six. Now you’ve got a number. You know what the mountain looks like.\nAnd if you’re not sure what your average matter value is – go ask finance, or better yet, go build a BD dashboard. (Or talk to us – we’re full of spreadsheets, charts, and unsolicited pep talks.)\nNext week\nOnce you know how many new instructions / jobs you need, you can plan the activity needed to generate them. Events, coffee catch-ups, client referrers, speaking gigs, LinkedIn posts – every action now has purpose.\nREMEMBER: You're not \"doing BD\" – you're building a pipeline to hit a target. One small hill at a time.\n\n \nIdeas\n•\tVerity – pricing\n•\tPaul Roberts – client feedback (actioning) \n\nconcentrated on that one killer email? You know what I’m talking about – it’s about 400 words, has been lawyered to death and the Call To Action (if there is one) is bured at the bottom\n\nExtract\nThree Things does what it says on the tin. A weekly sales and BD punch with three practical tips for instant execution.\n]\n\n"
